TI  - Isolation, cloning and functional analysis of a putative constitutive promoter ofE3 ubiquitin- protein ligase RF4 from Coleus amboinicus Lour.
LID - 10.1002/bab.2395 [doi]
AB  - Promoter is a region in the genome sequence located upstream of the transcriptionstart site comprising cis acting elements, which initiates and regulates thetranscription of an associated gene. As the need for genetically engineeredplants has widened, the requirement to develop methods to optimize the control oftransgene expression has also increased. Therefore, analyzing the functionalityof the promoter is very important in understanding the target gene expression.The widespread use of viral constitutive promoters (Cauliflower mosaic virus -CaMV35) has raised concerns about the safety and containment of the transgene in the environment. Hence isolation and characterization of novel promoters usingfast and efficient genetic engineering tools is the need of the hour. The presentstudy, for the first time, describes the isolation and characterization of anovel constitutive promoter driving Ubiquitin E3 ligase from the plant Coleusamboinicus, a perennial herb, of Lamiaceae family. The functionality of theisolated promoter was demonstrated using the beta Glucuronidase as a reporter in tobacco var Petit havana. Development of blue color in the tobacco leavesindicated the presence of a functional promoter. We describe for the first timethe isolation and characterization of E3 ubiquitin- protein ligase RF4 promoterfrom Coleus amboinicus Lour. In silico analysis revealed the presence of corepromoter elements and other responsive elements in the promoter. Thefunctionality of the promoter was demonstrated in tobacco leaf discs via GUSstaining. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Grouper interferon-induced protein 35, a CP-interacting protein, inhibited fishnodavirus replication via positively regulating host interferon and inflammatory immune response.

AB  - Interferon (IFN)-induced protein 35 (IFI35, also known as IFP35), a member of IFNinduced genes (ISGs), participates in virus infection, cancer progression and thechronic inflammatory diseases. However, its roles during fish nodavirus infectionstill remained largely unknown. In the present study, a homolog of IFI35 fromorange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (EcIFI35) was cloned andcharacterized. The open reading frame of EcIFI35 was composed of 1,128 bp, andencoded a 375 amino acid polypeptide, which contained two conservedN-myc-interactor (Nmi)/IFP35 domains (NIDs). Homology analysis indicated thatEcIFI35 shared 95.73% and 31.96% identity with homologs of giant grouper (E.lanceolatus) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. The transcription of EcIFI35was significantly up-regulated in grouper spleen (GS) cells after challenged withred-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), polyinosinic:polycytidylicacid [poly(I:C)] or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The subcellular localizationanalysis showed that EcIFI35 encoded a cytoplasmic protein. The ectopicexpression of EcIFI35 inhibited RGNNV replication by reducing viral genestranscription and protein synthesis. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assaydemonstrated that EcIFI35 interacted with RGNNV coat protein (CP), and partlyco-localized with CP. EcIFI35 overexpression promoted the expression ofIFN-related molecules and pro-inflammatory factors, including IFN regulatoryfactor 7 (IRF7), mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and myxovirusresistance gene I (MxI), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8. Together, our results revealed that EcIFI35 interacted with CP andinhibited fish nodavirus replication through positively regulated host innateimmune response.

AB  - The surveillance of migratory wild birds (MWBs) for avian influenza virus (AIV)allows detecting the emergence of highly pathogenic AIV that can infect domestic poultry and mammals, new subtypes, and antigenic/genetic variants. The currentAIV surveillance system for MWBs in the United States is based on virus isolation(VI) followed by sequencing isolates. This system primarily focuses on the early detection of H5 and H7 AIVs. However, it is suboptimal in assessing diverse AIVsubtypes at any given time because of the low VI success rate. To improve such a shortfall, a SYBR(R) Green-based real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction (rtRT-PCR) panel was developed for direct HA subtyping of AIVs inoropharyngeal-cloacal (OPC) swabs from MWBs. Under optimal conditions, the PCRpanel detected AIVs of all 16 different HA subtypes with an average limit ofdetection of 10(2.6) copies/reaction (2mul of extract). In testing 90 OPC swabsfrom 13 MWB species, the PCR provided a significantly faster turnaround ofresults and demonstrated the presence of more subtypes and concurrent infectionamong MWBs compared to what the current surveillance testing algorithm showed. Inconclusion, newly developed SYBR(R) Green rtRT-PCR panel can be a useful tool formonitoring MWBs for AIVs.

AB  - Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is a well-studied icosahedral plant virus that has attractive properties for nanoscience applications. Stable empty particlesdevoid of viral genomic RNA have historically been generated from virions by: 1. high pressure; 2. extreme alkaline pH; and 3. freeze-thaw using liquid nitrogen. Herein we report a fourth and more convenient avenue for empty particle formationthrough EDTA treatment, implicating chelation of virion-associated cations. Wepresent findings that confirm TYMV virions purified in an EDTA-based buffer areconverted to 94% empty on average during purification. Additional experimentationrevealed TYMV virions purified through CsCl vs. sucrose gradients are morereadily converted to empty particles after freeze thaw. These studies are novelas they show a purification method through EDTA-treatment that can generatestable empty particles devoid of viral genome. The convenience of this methodshould prove suitable for scientists seeking to use TYMV capsids innanoscience-inspired applications. Importantly, these findings provide insightinto historical discrepancies in creating empty particles after freeze-thaw, asthe method in which TYMV virions are purified influences the downstreamvirion-to-empty conversion process.

AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virusbelonging to the Flaviviridae family. The JEV is the leading cause of viralencephalitis in children and the elderly which is spread by mosquitoes. JEVinfection has been established in different animal models such as mouse, hamster,guinea pig, swine, rat, monkey, rabbit by using the different routes ofinoculations. Here, we have shown that the alpha/beta and gamma -receptordeficient AG129 mouse induces fatal encephalitis in both young and aged old mice,when challenged with high titer JEV Indian clinical isolate by both peritonealand intradermal route. The JEV infected AG129 mouse have shown neurologicalsymptoms, JEV-induced pathological features and supported high level viralreplication. Additionally, administration of JEV in AG129 mice resulted in theinduction of severe peripheral vascular permeability, which is a major hall mark of Dengue infection but not shown in JEV. Taken together, our results demonstrateinterferon alpha/beta and gamma receptors knock out AG129 mouse does not needadaptation of JEV clinical isolates and could be is a promising JEV challengemouse model by mimicking the natural intradermal route of administration forrapid screening of novel antivirals and vaccines.

AB  - The host response to virus infection is mediated by the interferon system and itsworkhorse effector proteins like Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Viperin isan interferon-inducible antiviral protein. In the present study, an antiviralradical SAM enzyme, viperin homologue, was cloned and characterised from teleost,Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). This cloned viperin cDNA encodes 351 amino acidprotein with predicted N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix, conserved radicalS-adenosyl l-methionine (SAM) domain with CxxxCxxC motif and a highly conservedC-terminal domain. Lcviperin gene consists of six exons and five introns. Thesecondary structure contains nine alpha helices and beta sheets. Viperin fromLates is evolutionarily conserved and shares about 89% identity with Serioladumerili and 70% identity with human orthologue. Poly(I:C) and RGNNV upregulated Lcviperin during in-vivo challenge studies, providing insight into its antiviral properties. Lates antiviral effector genes like viperin could help in elucidatingthe host-virus protein interactions and allow the development of improvedantiviral strategies against pathogens like betanodavirus that devastateaquaculture of the species.

AB  - Favipiravir (T-705, 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) selectively andstrongly inhibits the replication of influenza virus in vitro and in vivo.Favipiravir is converted to favipiravir-4-ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate(favipiravir RTP) by intracellular enzymes and functions as a nucleotide analogto selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of influenza virus.Our previous experiments failed in an attempt to obtain a favipiravir-resistantinfluenza virus in vitro using influenza virus A/PR/8/34(H1N1). Conversely,Goldhill et al. reported a favipiravir-resistant influenza virus generated by in vitro passage of influenza virus A/England/195/2009 (H1N1), an early isolate fromthe 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pdm09), in the presence of favipiravir with K229Rmutation in PB1. This study focused on K229R mutation near the NTP cross-linkedregion in PB1 based on the above conflicting findings to confirm whether K229Rmutation brings favipiravir resistance to influenza virus A/PR/8/34. Thirty PB1mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the NTP cross-linked regionwere evaluated using an influenza virus A/PR/8/34 replicon system. Among the 30mutants, 10 possessed but 20 lost replicon activity. When susceptibility tofavipiravir in 10 mutants was further assessed, the PB1 E491D mutant was fivetimes more sensitive than the wild-type (WT), while only the PB1 K229R mutant wasresistant to favipiravir. Results suggested that the evaluated region wasessential for polymerase activity, and K229 mutation was responsible forpolymerase inhibition of favipiravir in the influenza virus A/PR/8/34.Interestingly, the tested K229X series mutants entirely lost replicon activity,except for K229R. This suggested that the amino acid at position 229 in PB1 ofinfluenza virus may play a pivotal role in polymerase activity. Moreover, thislysine residue is highly conserved among positive- and negative-sensesingle-stranded RNA viruses, in which favipiravir showed potent activity,suggesting that this mutation may determine the characterization of the in vitro broad-spectrum activity of favipiravir. Additionally, this mutation acquisitiongreatly influences the viral replication and the susceptibility to favipiravir.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genomeconstitutively encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein N, forming a helicalnucleocapsid which is the template for viral transcription and replication by theviral polymerase L. Recruitment of L onto the nucleocapsid depends on the viralphosphoprotein P, which is an essential L cofactor. A prerequisite for genome andantigenome encapsidation is the presence of the monomeric, RNA-free,neosynthesised N protein, named N(0). Stabilisation of N(0) depends on thebinding of the N-terminal residues of P to its surface, which prevents Noligomerisation. However, the mechanism involved in the transition from N(0)-P tonucleocapsid assembly, and thus in the specificity of viral genome encapsidation,is still unknown. Furthermore, the specific role of N oligomerisation and RNA in the morphogenesis of viral factories, where viral transcription and replicationoccur, have not been elucidated although the interaction between P and Ncomplexed to RNA has been shown to be responsible for this process. Here, using achimeric protein comprising N and the first 40 N-terminal residues of P, wesucceeded in purifying a recombinant N(0)-like protein competent for RNAencapsidation in vitro. Our results showed the importance of RNA length forstable encapsidation and revealed that the nature of the 5' end of RNA does notexplain the specificity of encapsidation. Finally, we showed that RNAencapsidation is crucial for the in vitro reconstitution of pseudo-viralfactories. Together, our findings provide insight into RSV viral genomeencapsidation specificity.

AB  - A small number of offspring are born from the numerous sperm generated fromspermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). However, little is known regarding the rulesand molecular mechanisms that govern germline transmission patterns. Here wereport that the Trp53 tumor suppressor gene limits germline genetic diversity viaCdkn1a. Trp53-deficient SSCs outcompeted wild-type (WT) SSCs and producedsignificantly more progeny after co-transplantation into infertile mice.Lentivirus-mediated transgenerational lineage analysis showed that offspringbearing the same virus integration were repeatedly born in a non-random patternfrom WT SSCs. However, SSCs lacking Trp53 or Cdkn1a sired transgenic offspring inrandom patterns with increased genetic diversity. Apoptosis of KIT(+)differentiating germ cells was reduced in Trp53- or Cdkn1a-deficient mice.Reduced CDKN1A expression in Trp53-deficient spermatogonia suggested that Cdkn1a limits genetic diversity by supporting apoptosis of syncytial spermatogonialclones. Therefore, the TRP53-CDKN1A pathway regulates tumorigenesis and thegermline transmission pattern.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the infectious agent that shows the strongestassociation with multiple sclerosis (MS). EBV is a ubiquitous double stranded DNAherpes virus that establishes a latent infection in B cells and is activelycontained by the immune system throughout the life of its human host. Failure to control EBV infection can lead to the development of cancers andimmunopathological diseases characterized by hyperreactive anti-EBV immuneresponses. Although MS is the result of still poorly understood interactionsbetween genetic and environmental factors, compelling evidence indicates that EBVinfection is essential for MS initiation. B cells are clearly key in thedevelopment of MS activity, given the extraordinary effectiveness of B celldepleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in relapsing MS patients. Thiscommentary reviews the evidence supporting the link of EBV with MS and themechanisms by which EBV might trigger MS and cause continued disease activity.Also discussed are trials of agents to reduce or eliminate EBV in humans, whichare expected to provide additional insights into the role of EBV in ongoing MSpathology.

AB  - In the United States, the cost of providing employer-sponsored health insurance(ESI) varies for employers based on the medical expenditures of their employees, a practice known as "experience rating". Experience rating increases the cost of employing workers who have greater medical expenditures, one example being men insame-sex couples. To study whether ESI affects labor market outcomes for men insame-sex couples, I use the 2012 advent of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a$24,000 per year drug that effectively prevents Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) acquisition. Using American Community Survey data and adifference-in-difference empirical approach - comparing post-PrEP changes inearnings among men who have ESI - I find that annual earnings for men in same-sexcouples decline by $2,650 (approximately 3.9%) relative to comparable men afterPrEP becomes available. For those who are most likely to be taking Truvada (thebrand name for PrEP), such as young men and white men, effects on earnings areconsiderably larger. I also observe a 3.7 percentage point (4.6%) decline in ESI prevalence and a 0.8 percentage point (10.7%) increase in part-time employmentamong men in same-sex couples. Event studies provide support for a causalinterpretation for my findings. My estimates are also robust to placebo analyses,various specification permutations, and a range of sensitivity checks.

AB  - Although not critical for hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, splicing of HBVpre-genomic RNA generates multiple HBV splice variants, some of which have beenshown to impact replication of the genome-length HBV on which they rely for theirreplication. To date, all replication studies of splice variants have utilisedtruncated RNA or over-expression constructs, and studies utilising constructsthat produce authentic splice derived HBV RNA are lacking. Here we utilise agreater than genome length model to interrogate the complete replicationphenotype of HBV splice variant Sp1, and investigate mechanisms by which itnegatively impacts genome-length HBV replication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autopsy studies have provided valuable insights into thepathophysiology of COVID-19. Controversies remain about whether the clinicalpresentation is due to direct organ damage by SARS-CoV-2 or secondary effects,such as overshooting immune response. SARS-CoV-2 detection in tissues by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) or electron microscopy (EM) can help answer these questions, but a comprehensive evaluation of these applications is missing.METHODS: We assessed publications using IHC and EM for SARS-CoV-2 detection inautopsy tissues. We systematically evaluated commercially available antibodiesagainst the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in cultured cell lines and COVID-19 autopsytissues. In a multicentre study, we evaluated specificity, reproducibility, andinter-observer variability of SARS-CoV-2 IHC. We correlated RT-qPCR viral tissue loads with semiquantitative IHC scoring. We used qualitative and quantitative EM analyses to refine criteria for ultrastructural identification of SARS-CoV-2.FINDINGS: Publications show high variability in detection and interpretation ofSARS-CoV-2 abundance in autopsy tissues by IHC or EM. We show that IHC usingantibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid yields the highest sensitivity andspecificity. We found a positive correlation between presence of viral proteinsby IHC and RT-qPCR-determined SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (N= 35; r=-0.83, p-value <0.0001). For EM, we refined criteria for virus identification and providerecommendations for optimized sampling and analysis. 135 of 144 publicationsmisinterpret cellular structures as virus using EM or show only insufficientdata. We provide publicly accessible digitized EM sections as a reference and fortraining purposes. INTERPRETATION: Since detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human autopsytissues by IHC and EM is difficult and frequently incorrect, we propose criteria for a re-evaluation of available data and guidance for further investigations of direct organ effects by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Coronavirus is a type of RNA-positive single-stranded virus with an envelope, andthe spines on its surface derived its official name. Seven human coronaviruses229E, OC43, SARS, NL63, HKU1, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 can cause both a mild cold and an epidemic of large-scale deaths and injuries. Although their clinicalmanifestations and many other pathogens that cause human colds are similar,studying the relationship between their evolutionary history and the receptorsthat infect the host can provide important insights into the natural history ofhuman epidemics in the past and future. In this review, we describe the basicvirology of these seven coronaviruses, their partial genome characteristics, and emphasize the function of receptors. We summarize the current understanding ofthese viruses and discuss the potential host of wild animals of thesecoronaviruses and the origin of zoonotic diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis A (HA) remains a common infection globally that results in a self-limiting hepatitis with gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Directdetection of the virus in blood or stool is often not possible once symptomatic. Serological testing is frequently performed to investigate abnormal liverfunction tests - and interpretation of equivocal and low-level positiveanti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM is difficult even in the context of accurateepidemiological and clinical information. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project wasto characterise the association between low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM resultsand clinical disease. STUDY DESIGN: Anti-HAV serology results recorded over 22months were analysed. Equivocal and positive Architect anti-HAV IgM results were matched with available clinical and demographical data to identify confirmed and probable cases of acute HAV infection. RESULTS: Reactive anti-HAV IgM resultswere recorded for 88/7661 (1.15%) samples. Using clinical and laboratory data, 35patients were confirmed to have acute HAV infection. Acute HA was associated witha mean Architect anti-HAV IgM value of 9.4 (SD 6.8-12.0). Cases of HA had a mean peak ALT value of 1920 (SD 682-3158). All confirmed cases (35/35) of acute HAVwere associated with at least one clinical indicator, with 28/31 cases (90%)having a documented jaundice. All 35 (100%) cases of acute HAV infection hadanti-HAV IgM > 4.0. A diagnosis other than acute HA was identified in 7/11(63.6%) of low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results (clinical data unavailable forfurther 4/11, 36.3%). Where clinical information was available, acute HA wasexcluded in all 31 patients with equivocal or low-level reactive anti-HAV IgMresults. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of reports sent out to the clinician showedroom for improvement. An interpretive algorithm is proposed including aclinically significant cut-off value for anti-HAV IgM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hyperinoculation of cats with a felineherpesvirus-1, calicivirus, and panleukopenia virus (FVRCP) vaccine could be usedas a model to study interstitial nephritis and to assess humoral andcell-mediated immune responses toward vaccinal alpha-enolase. ANIMALS: 6 healthy young adult purpose-bred research cats. PROCEDURES: Baseline renal corticalbiopsies, whole blood, serum, and urine were collected prior to administration ofa commercial FVRCP parenteral vaccine. Vaccine hyperinoculation was defined as a total of 8 vaccinations given at 2-week intervals over a 14-week period. Bloodsamples were collected immediately prior to each vaccination, and a second renal biopsy was performed 2 weeks after hyperinoculation (week 16). Renalhistopathology, renal alpha-enolase immunohistochemistry, and assays to detecthumoral and cell-mediated immune reactions against Crandell-Rees feline kidney(CRFK) cell lysates and alpha-enolase were performed. An alpha-enolaseimmunoreactivity score for renal tubules and glomeruli based on signal intensity was determined by a blinded pathologist. RESULTS: Hyperinoculation with thevaccine was not associated with clinicopathologic evidence of renal dysfunction, and interstitial nephritis was not recognized by light microscopy in the timestudied. The mean serum absorbance values for antibodies against CRFK antigen andalpha-enolase were significantly (P < 0.001) higher at weeks 4, 8, and 16 versus week 0. Renal tubular and glomerular alpha-enolase immunoreactivity scores werehigher at week 16 compared to baseline. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings suggestedthat systemic immunological reactions occurred and renal tissues were affected byvaccine hyperinoculation; however, short-term FVRCP vaccine hyperinoculationcannot be used to study interstitial nephritis in cats.

AB  - Introduction: Due to the measures imposed by governments to reduce the spread of this new virus, the economic sector was one of the most affected during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Several labor sectors had to undergo a virtual adaptationprocess resulting in job instability and job loss. The objective of this studywas to revalidate an ultra-short scale for measuring perceived job security inLatin America. Methods: A revalidation study was done on a short scale thatmeasures worker's perceived security about losing or keeping their job in thenear future. Results: The four items remained on the revalidated scale, where allfour explained a single factor. The goodness-of-fit measures confirmed thesingle-factor model (chi: 7.06; df: 2; p = 0.29; mean square error: 0.015;goodness-of-fit index: 0.998; adjusted goodness-of-fit index: 0.991; comparative fit index: 0.999; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.997; normalized fit index: 0.998;incremental fit index: 0.999; and root mean square error of approximation:0.036). The scale's reliability was calculated using McDonald's omegacoefficient, obtaining an overall result of omega = 0.72. Conclusions: The scale was correctly revalidated in Latin America, and the four items were kept in asingle reliable factor.

TI  - Assessing suspension and infectivity times of virus-loaded aerosols involved inairborne transmission.
PG  - e2204593119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2204593119 [doi]
AB  - Airborne transmission occurs through droplet-mediated transport of virusesfollowing the expulsion of an aerosol by an infected host. Transmissionefficiency results from the interplay between virus survival in the dryingdroplet and droplet suspension time in the air, controlled by the couplingbetween water evaporation and droplet sedimentation. Furthermore, droplets aremade of a respiratory fluid and thus, display a complex composition consisting ofwater and nonvolatile solutes. Here, we quantify the impact of this complexcomposition on the different phenomena underlying transmission. Solutes lead to anonideal thermodynamic behavior, which sets an equilibrium droplet size that isindependent of relative humidity. In contrast, solutes do not significantlyhinder transport due to their low initial concentration. Realistic suspensiontimes are computed and increase with increasing relative humidity or decreasingtemperature. By uncoupling drying and suspended stages, we observe that envelopedviruses may remain infectious for hours in dried droplets. However, theirinfectivity decreases with increasing relative humidity or temperature afterdozens of minutes. Examining expelled droplet size distributions in the light of these results leads to distinguishing two aerosols. Most droplets measure between0 and 40 microm and compose an aerosol that remains suspended for hours. Itstransmission efficiency is controlled by infectivity, which decreases withincreasing humidity and temperature. Larger droplets form an aerosol that onlyremains suspended for minutes but corresponds to a much larger volume and thus,viral load. Its transmission efficiency is controlled by droplet suspension time,which decreases with increasing humidity and decreasing temperature.

AB  - Improving the thermal stability of biologics, including vaccines, is critical to reduce the economic costs and health risks associated with the cold chain. Here, we designed a versatile, safe, and easy-to-use reversible PEG-based hydrogelplatform formed via dynamic covalent boronic ester cross-linking for theencapsulation, stabilization, and on-demand release of biologics. Using thesereversible hydrogels, we thermally stabilized a wide range of biologics up to 65 degrees C, including model enzymes, heat-sensitive clinical diagnostic enzymes(DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I), protein-based vaccines (H5N1 hemagglutinin),and whole viruses (adenovirus type 5). Our data support a generalized protection mechanism for the thermal stabilization of diverse biologics using directencapsulation in reversible hydrogels. Furthermore, preliminary toxicology datasuggest that the components of our hydrogel are safe for in vivo use. Ourreversible hydrogel platform offers a simple material solution to mitigate thecosts and risks associated with reliance on a continuous cold chain for biologic transport and storage.

PG  - eabo4184
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abo4184 [doi]
AB  - The loss of detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered afunctional cure in chronic hepatitis B. Naturally, HBsAg can be incorporated intothe virion envelope or assembled into subviral particles (SVPs) with lipid fromhost cells. Until now, there has been no detailed structure of HBsAg, and thepublished SVP structures are controversial. Here, we report the firstsubnanometer-resolution structures of spherical SVP from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the related woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) determined by cryo-electronmicroscopy in combination with AlphaFold2 prediction. Both structures showedunique rhombicuboctahedral symmetry with 24 protruding spikes comprising dimer ofsmall HBsAg with four helical domains. The lipid moiety in the SVP is organizedin a noncanonical lipid patch instead of a lipid bilayer, which can accommodatethe exposed hydrophobic surface and modulate particle stability. Together, these findings advance our knowledge of viral membrane organization and the structures of HBV and WHV spherical SVPs.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272809 [doi]
AB  - In the United States (U.S.), a hepatitis E virus (HEV) seroprevalence between 6and 21% has been described, with a decreasing trend. We aimed to investigate HEV infection in the U.S. population from 2009 to 2016, and examine the differencesin seroprevalence using different assays. We used data from the National Healthand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-CDC) to estimate HEV seroprevalence and analyze demographic variables related to the infection. Additionally, we compared4 serological tests used. The estimated HEV seroprevalence between 2009-2016 was 6.1% (95% CI: 5.6%-7.0%) for IgG and 1.02% (0.8%-1.2%) for IgM. Higher HEV IgGprevalences were found in older people, females, non-Hispanic Asians and thoseborn outside of the U.S. The in-house immunoassay and the Wantai HEV-IgG ELISApresented the highest sensitivity values in the tested population. The highestspecificity values corresponded to the DSI-EIA-ANTI-HEV-IgG assay. The kappastatistical values showed concordances no greater than 0.64 between the assays.HEV prevalence in our study was similar to previously reported, and a decline in the prevalence was observed through the NHANES assessments (from 1988 to 2016).The sensitivity and specificity of the assays varied widely, making comparisonsdifficult and highlighting the need to develop a gold standard assay.

TI  - Influenza A virus elicits peri-vascular adipose tissue inflammation and vascular dysfunction of the aorta in pregnant mice.
PG  - e1010703
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010703 [doi]
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy initiates significant aorticendothelial and vascular smooth muscle dysfunction, with inflammation and T cell activation, but the details of the mechanism are yet to be clearly defined. Here we demonstrate that IAV disseminates preferentially into the perivascular adiposetissue (PVAT) of the aorta in mice. IAV mRNA levels in the PVAT increased at 1-3 days post infection (d.p.i) with the levels being ~4-8 fold higher compared with the vessel wall. IAV infection also increased Ly6Clow patrolling monocytes andLy6Chigh pro-inflammatory monocytes in the vessel wall at 3 d.p.i., which wasthen followed by a greater homing of these monocytes into the PVAT at 6 d.p.i.The vascular immune phenotype was characteristic of a "vascular storm"- likeresponse, with increases in neutrophils, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidativestress markers in the PVAT and arterial wall, which was associated with animpairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. IAV alsotriggered a PVAT compartmentalised elevation in CD4+ and CD8+ activated T cells. In conclusion, the PVAT of the aorta is a niche that supports IAV disseminationand a site for perpetuating a profound innate inflammatory and adaptive T cellresponse. The manifestation of this inflammatory response in the PVAT followingIAV infection may be central to the genesis of cardiovascular complicationsarising during pregnancy.

TI  - Online searches of children's oseltamivir in public primary and specialized care:Detecting influenza outbreaks in Finland using dedicated databases for healthcare professionals.
PG  - e0272040
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272040 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health care professionals working in primary and specialized caretypically search for medical information from Internet sources. In Finland,Physician's Databases are online portals aimed at professionals seeking medicalinformation. As dosage errors may occur when prescribing medication to children, professionals' need for reliable medical information has increased in publichealth care centers and hospitals. Influenza continues to be a public healththreat, with young children at risk of developing severe illness and easilytransmitting the virus. Oseltamivir is used to treat children with influenza. Theobjective of this study was to compare searches for children's oseltamivir andinfluenza diagnoses in primary and specialized care, and to determine if thesearches could aid detection of influenza outbreaks. METHODS: We comparedsearches in Physician's Databases for children's oral suspension of oseltamivir(6 mg/mL) for influenza diagnoses of children under 7 years and laboratoryfindings of influenza A and B from the National Infectious Disease Register.Searches and diagnoses were assessed in primary and specialized care acrossFinland by season from 2012-2016. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) calculatedseasonal starts and ends, and paired differences in the mean compared twoindicators. Correlation was tested to compare seasons. RESULTS: We found thatsearches and diagnoses in primary and specialized care showed visually similarpatterns annually. The MEM-calculated starting weeks in searches appeared mainly in the same week. Oseltamivir searches in primary care preceded diagnoses by -1.0weeks (95% CI: -3.0, -0.3; p = 0.132) with very high correlation (tau = 0.913).Specialized care oseltamivir searches and diagnoses correlated moderately (tau = 0.667). CONCLUSION: Health care professionals' searches for children'soseltamivir in online databases linked with the registers of children's influenzadiagnoses in primary and specialized care. Therefore, database searches should beconsidered as supplementary information in disease surveillance when detectinginfluenza epidemics.

PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/09553002.2022.2110301 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a major cause ofmorbidity and mortality. Although HNSCC is mainly caused by tobacco and alcoholconsumption, infection by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has been also associatedwith the increasing incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC)during the past decades. HPV-positive HNSCC is characterized by a higherradiosensitivity compared to HPV-negative tumor. While several clinical trialsare evaluating de-escaladed radiation doses strategies in HPV-positive HNSCC,molecular mechanisms associated with relative radioresistance in HPV-negativeHNSCC are still broadly unknown. Our goal was to review recently proposedbiomarkers of radioresistance in this setting, which may be useful forstratifying tumor's patient according to predicted level of radioresistance.CONCLUSIONS: most of biomarkers of radioresistance in HPV-negative HNSCC areidentified using a hypothesis-driven approach, based on molecular mechanismsknown to play a key role during carcinogenesis, compared to an unsuperviseddata-driven approach regardless the biological rational. DNA repair and hypoxiaare the two most widely investigated biological and targetable pathways relatedto radioresistance in HNSCC. The better understanding of molecular mechanisms andbiomarkers of radioresistance in HPV-negative HNSCC could help for thedevelopment of radiosensitization strategies, based on targetable biomarkers, in radioresistant tumors as well as de-escalation radiation dose strategies, basedon biological level of radioresistance, in radiosensitive tumors.

AB  - Flavonoids are a diversified group of natural substances which were discovered toprovide a variety of health benefits in human beings. Vegetables, fruits, wineand tea are the primary flavonoid dietary sources for humans and as theflavonoids are so closely connected to human dietary items and health, it isvital to explore the structural-activity connection. The arrangement, replacementof functional groups, and total number of hydroxyl groups around flavonoid'snucleus structure affect their biological activity, metabolism, andbioavailability. Various flavonoids have been proven to have hepatoprotectiveproperties, that help in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Similarly,these flavonoids also possess anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities.Flavonoids have been found to have a functional and structural link with theirenzyme inhibitory action, that appears to have antiviral effect through acting asantioxidants, damaging cell membranes, blocking enzymes, activating mechanisms ofhost self-defense, and limiting virus penetration and attaching to cells.Identification, characterization, isolation, and biological role of flavonoids,as well as their uses on health advantages, are all major topics in research and development currently. This review represents a summary of various sources offlavonoids, class, subclass, their chemical structures, biological activities,the pharmacokinetics of flavonoids and various analytical, bioanalytical andelectrochemical methods for determination of flavonoids from different matrices.

PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/10408363.2022.2102578 [doi]
AB  - While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) begins as a respiratory infection, itprogresses as a systemic disease involving multiorgan microthromboses thatunderly the pathology. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via attachment to theangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed in amultitude of tissues, including the lung (alveolar cells), heart, intestine,kidney, testis, gallbladder, vasculature (endothelial cells), and immune cells.Interference in ACE2 signaling could drive the aforementioned systemicpathologies, such as endothelial dysfunction, microthromboses, and systemicinflammation, that are typically seen in patients with severe COVID-19. ACE2 is acomponent of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is intimately associated withthe plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). As many papers are published on therole of ACE and ACE2 in COVID-19, we will review the role of bradykinin, and morebroadly the KSS, in SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, we willdiscuss the possible therapeutic interventions that are approved and indevelopment for the following targets: coagulation factor XII (FXII), tissuekallikrein (KLK1), plasma kallikrein (KLKB1), bradykinin (BK), plasminogenactivator inhibitor (PAI-1), bradykinin B1 receptor (BKB1R), bradykinin B2receptor (BKB2R), ACE, furin, and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Understanding thesetargets may prove of value in the treatment of COVID-19 as well as in othervirus-induced coagulopathies in the future.

TI  - Defining a Cesarean Delivery Rate for Optimizing Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes.
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004876 [doi]
AB  - After the global cesarean delivery rate nearly doubled between 2000 and 2015,cesarean deliveries now account for nearly one third of births in the UnitedStates. Although rates have plateaued, the high national cesarean delivery ratehas garnered criticism from both lay and academic communities because it has not been associated with improvements in maternal or neonatal outcomes. Efforts areunderway to lower the cesarean delivery rate through implementation ofhospital-level and national guidelines. However, the cesarean delivery rate that optimizes maternal and neonatal outcomes is not known. Defining a cesareandelivery rate that optimizes perinatal outcomes and reduces morbidity seemssimple. However, there are a host of challenges to such a task, includingdetermining the outcomes that are most meaningful to use, deciding the populationthat should define the rate, and incorporating person-centered decision making,given that people place different value on different outcomes. Rather than a"call" for cesarean delivery rate reductions of a specific and arbitrarymagnitude, we need further attention to defining an evidence-based optimaltarget. This commentary summarizes current national and international cesareandelivery rate targets, discusses the challenges of identifying an evidence-based national cesarean delivery rate target, and explores future considerations forbest defining a cesarean delivery rate target.

AB  - Women of African ancestry have the highest mortality from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) of all racial groups. To understand the genomic basis of breastcancer in the populations, we previously conducted genome-wide associationstudies (GWAS) and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associatedwith breast cancer in Black women. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of the top associated SNP rs13074711. We found the SNP served as an enhancer variant and regulated TNFSF10 (TRAIL) expression in TNBC cells, with asignificant association between the SNP genotype and TNFSF10 expression in breasttumors. Mechanistically, rs13074711 modulated the binding activity of c-MYB atthe motif and thereby controlled TNFSF10 expression. Interestingly, TNFSF10expression in many cancers was consistently lower in African Americans (AA)compared to European Americans (EA). Furthermore, TNFSF10 expression in TNBC was significantly correlated with expression of antiviral immune genes and wasregulated by type I interferons (IFNs). Accordingly, loss of TNFSF10 resulted in a profound decrease in apoptosis of TNBC cells in response to type I IFNs andpoly (I:C), a synthetic analogue of double stranded virus. Lastly, in a syngeneicmouse model of breast cancer, TNFSF10-deficiency in breast tumors decreasedtumor-infiltrated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell quantities. Collectively, our resultssuggested that TNFSF10 plays an important role in the regulation of antiviralimmune responses in TNBC, and the expression is in part regulated by a geneticvariant associated with breast cancer in Black women. Our results underscore the important contributions of genetic variants to immune defense mechanisms.

AB  - The prefatory protein-glycan interaction and stabilizing protein-proteininteraction of severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses withangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 play a significant role in complex formationthereby promoting endocytosis. The microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 over a period of time has a significant role in increasing the affinity of receptor-binding domainagainst angiotensin converting-enzyme 2. In this study, we have corroborated the vitality of acquired SNPs over a period of time with increased affinity by using docking studies. The results indicate that the virus modulates the undesirableglycosylation sites by a series of substitution and deletion mutations. It usesbulky residues such as Tyr/Phe for dynamic arrest for quick stabilization of the complex, and Lys residues for stabilizing via hydrogen bond formation besidesincreasing the binding affinity to ease the cell entry.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

PG  - 1-15

AB  - Even after virus elimination, numerous sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) persist. Based on accumulating evidence, large amounts ofproinflammatory cytokines are released to drive COVID-19 progression, severity,and mortality, and their levels remain elevated after the acute phase ofCOVID-19, playing a central role in the disease' sequelae. In this manner,bronchial epithelial cells are the first cells hyperactivated by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to massive cytokinerelease, triggering the hyperactivation of leukocytes and other cells, andmediating COVID-19 sequelae. Therefore, proinflammatory cytokine production isinitiated by the host. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis thatImmuneRecov, a nutritional blend, inhibits the SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperactivationof human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). BEAS-2B (5x10(4)/mL/well) cellswere cocultivated with 1 ml of blood from a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient for 4 h, and the nutritional blend (1 microg/mL) was added in the first minute ofcoculture. After 4 h, the cells were recovered and used for analyses ofcytotoxicity with the (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide) (MTT) assay and the expression of the IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNAs.The supernatant was collected to measure cytokine levels. SARS-CoV-2 incubationresulted in increased levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 in BEAS-2B cells (p < 0.001).Treatment with the nutritional blend resulted in reduced levels of theproinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 (p < 0.001) and increased levels ofthe anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (p < 0.001). Additionally, the nutritionalblend reduced the expression of the IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNAs inSARS-CoV-2-stimulated cells and increased the expression of the IL-10 andIFN-gamma mRNAs. In conclusion, the nutritional blend exerts importantanti-inflammatory effects on cells in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Preoperative serum hepatitis B virus DNA was a risk factor for hepatocellularcarcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation.
PG  - 2213-2221
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2107233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumour characteristics and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)criteria are risks for recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In Asia,most HCC is caused by chronic hepatitis B infection. Whether hepatitis B virusDNA (HBV DNA) is a risk factor for HCC recurrence after OLT is not clear.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we classified patients intogroups of detectable and undetectable HBV DNA, non-HCC recurrence, and recurrenceand performed analyses on differed characteristics between groups and riskfactors for HCC recurrence after OLT. RESULTS: Among patients who underwent OLTfor HCC, 117 were secondary to CHB infection. CHB was not a risk, but advancedtumour characteristics were risk factor for HCC recurrence. In patients withCHB-HCC, 24 (20.5%) of 117 patients had HCC recurrence. Compared to patients withHBV DNA undetectable (n = 75), patients with detectable HBV DNA (n = 42) hadhigher AFP concentration (p < .001), higher proportion of macrovascular invasion (p = .014), greater tumour diameter (p < .001), poorer TNM stage (p = .017), and higher proportion of extended OLT criteria (p = .011) and HCC recurrence (p =.036). Preoperative HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL was an independent risk factor for HCCrecurrence (OR = 8.35, 95% CI 1.40, 50.00, p = .020). HBV DNA detectable was not a risk for HCC-related death. CONCLUSION: Individuals with preoperativeundetectable HBV DNA had advanced tumour characteristics and a higher proportion of HCC recurrence. Antiviral treatment for HCC should be performed, and HBV DNAundetectable should be obtained before OLT. But for an urgent OLT, preoperativedetectable HBV DNA may not affect long-term survival.KEY MESSAGESPatients withHBV DNA detectable had advanced tumour characteristics, a higher proportion ofextended OLT criteria, and HCC-recurrence.HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL was a risk factorfor HCC recurrence.HBV DNA detectable was not a risk for HCC related death;extended OLT criteria affected long-term survival.

LID - 10.1080/17474086.2022.2110061 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is associated to an increased risk of thrombosis, as aresult of a complex process that involves the activation of vascular andcirculating cells, the release of soluble inflammatory and thrombotic mediatorsand blood clotting activation. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews thepathophysiological role of platelets, neutrophils and the endothelium, and oftheir interactions, in the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 patients, and thecurrent and future therapeutic approaches targeting these cell types. EXPERTOPINION: Virus-induced platelet, neutrophil and endothelial cell changes arecrucial triggers of the thrombotic complications and of the adverse evolution of COVID-19. Both the direct interaction with the virus and the associated cytokine storm concur to trigger cell activation in a classical thromboinflammatoryvicious circle. Although heparin has proven to be an effective prophylactic andtherapeutic weapon for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19-associatedthrombosis, it acts downstream of the cascade of events triggered by SARS-CoV-2. The identification of specific molecular targets interrupting thethromboinflammatory cascade upstream, and more specifically acting either on the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with blood and vascular cells or on the specificsignalling mechanisms associated with their COVID-19-associated activation, mighttheoretically offer greater protection with potentially lesser side effects.

AB  - To prevent interhuman transmission of viruses, new mask types horizontal lineclaiming improved filtration horizontal line require careful performancecharacterization. Here, a microfluidic spray device that can effectively simulatedroplets emitted during coughing or sneezing was developed to spray dropletscontaining gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that mimic SARS-CoV-2 to overcome theshortcomings associated with using biosamples. The light scattered by the AuNPspassing through the mask is successfully analyzed by using an automatedscattering light mapping system within a duration of 2 min, thereby enablinghigh-throughput analysis of the filtering efficiency of various types ofcommercial masks. The differences in efficiency in terms of same mask type fromdifferent manufacturers, double masking, and prolonged usage, which arechallenging to analyze with conventional testing systems, can also be assessed.AuNP-mediated mask performance evaluation enables the rapid determination of maskefficiency according to particle size and can contribute to the rapid response tocounter new emerging infectious biohazards.

AB  - Today, with the intensity of antibiotic abuse and self-medication, the need forthe use of novel systems with high efficiency and biosafety for targeted drugdelivery against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their infections should behighly considered by researchers. Silica-based nanosystems with uniquephysicochemical properties such as large surface area, tuneable pore diameter,drug loading capacity, controlled particle size/morphology, and goodbiocompatibility are attractive candidates against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and pathogenic viruses. They can be loaded with antiviral and antimicrobial drugsor molecules through their exclusive internal porous structures or differentsurface linkers. In this context, smart nanosystems can be produced via suitable surface functionalization/modification with a variety of functional groups to actagainst different clinical pathogenic microbes or viruses, offering greatopportunities for controlling and treating various infections. However, importantcriteria such as the ability to degrade, biocompatibility, biodegradability,cytotoxicity, stability, clearance from targeted organs should be systematically analysed to develop nanosystems or nanocarriers with high efficiency andmultifunctionality. Herein, recent advancements pertaining to the application of silica-based nanosystems against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and pathogenicviruses are deliberated, focussing on important challenges and futureperspectives.

TI  - Jacareubin inhibits TLR4-induced lung inflammatory response caused by the RBDdomain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.
LID - 10.1007/s43440-022-00398-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, has been a major public health problem worldwide in the last 2 years. SARS-CoV-2-dependentactivation of innate immune receptors contributes to the strong local andsystemic inflammatory reaction associated with rapid disease evolution. Thereceptor-binding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) viral protein (S-RBD) is essential forvirus infection and its interacting molecules in target cells are still underidentification. On the other hand, the search for accessible natural moleculeswith potential therapeutic use has been intense and remains an active field ofinvestigation. METHODS: C57BL6/J (control) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-deficient (Lps del) mice were nebulized with recombinant S-RBD. Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin (IL)-6 production in bronchoalveolarlavages (BALs) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Lung-infiltrating cells recovered in BALs were quantified by hematoxylin-eosin(H&E) stain. In selected groups of animals, the natural compound Jacareubin ordexamethasone were intraperitoneally (ip) administered 2 hours beforenebulization. RESULTS: A rapid lung production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 and cellinfiltration was induced by S-RBD nebulization in control but not in Lps delmice. Pre-treatment with Jacareubin or dexamethasone prevented S-RBD-inducedTNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion in BALs from control animals. CONCLUSIONS: S-RBDdomain promotes lung TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in a TLR4-dependent fashion inC57BL6/J mice. Xanthone Jacareubin possesses potential anti-COVID-19 propertiesthat, together with the previously tested anti-inflammatory activity, safety, andtolerance, make it a valuable drug to be further investigated for the treatmentof cytokine production caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 pharmaceutical drugs: a critical review on the environmental impacts, chemical characteristics, and behavior of advanced oxidation processes in water.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22234-2 [doi]
AB  - This review summarizes research data on the pharmaceutical drugs used to treatthe novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, their characteristics, environmental impacts, and theadvanced oxidation processes (AOP) applied to remove them. A literature surveywas conducted using the electronic databases Science Direct, Scopus, Taylor &Francis, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Springer. This complete research includesand discusses relevant studies that involve the introduction, pharmaceuticaldrugs used in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: chemical characteristics and environmentalimpact, advanced oxidation process (AOP), future trends and discussion, andconclusions. The results show a full approach in the versatility of AOPs as apromising solution to minimize the environmental impact associated with thesecompounds by the fact that they offer different ways for hydroxyl radicalproduction. Moreover, this article focuses on introducing the fundamentals ofeach AOP, the main parameters involved, and the concomitance with other sourcesand modifications over the years. Photocatalysis, sonochemical technologies,electro-oxidation, photolysis, Fenton reaction, ozone, and sulfate radical AOPhave been used to mineralize SARS-CoV-2 pharmaceutical compounds, and theefficiencies are greater than 65%. According to the results, photocatalysis isthe main technology currently applied to remove these pharmaceuticals. Thisprocess has garnered attention because solar energy can be directly utilized;however, low photocatalytic efficiencies and high costs in large-scale practical applications limit its use. Furthermore, pharmaceuticals in the environment arediverse and complex. Finally, the review also provides ideas for further researchneeds and major concerns.

TI  - The Incidence Rate of Sexual Behaviors Among Cisgender Men who have Sex with Men Attending a Sexual Health Clinic.
LID - 10.1007/s10508-022-02370-z [doi]
AB  - Although nuanced parameterization of sexual behavior may improve estimates frommathematical models of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmittedinfection transmission, prospective estimates of the incidence of specific sexualbehaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM) are limited. From December 2014to July 2018, MSM with and without nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) completedweekly diaries over 3-12 weeks. Incidence rates of any sex, receptive anal sex,insertive anal sex, insertive oral sex, receptive rimming, and receptivehand-penile contact were 1.19, 0.28, 0.66, 0.90, 0.24, and 0.85 episodes perperson-week, respectively, among 104 MSM with NGU at baseline, and 1.33, 0.54,0.32, 0.95, 0.44, and 0.88 episodes per person-week, respectively, among 25 MSMwithout NGU at baseline. Most receptive anal sex (NGU + 83%, NGU - 86%) andinsertive anal sex (NGU + 85%, NGU - 76%) episodes were condomless. MSM engagedin sex just over once per week, and condom use was infrequent. Insertive oral sexand receptive hand-penile contact were the most common behaviors.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology on seasonal variation of yellow mosaic disease incidencein blackgram (Vigna mungo L. Hepper) with its vector Bemisia tabaci.
LID - 10.1007/s00484-022-02334-x [doi]
AB  - The yellow mosaic disease (YMD) of blackgram caused by Mungbean yellow mosaicvirus has emerged as a serious threat to grain legume production, especially inSoutheastern Asia. Seasonal incidence of YMD with its vector population wasassessed in three different agroclimatic zones of Tamil Nadu in India for threeconsecutive cropping seasons namely, Rabi 2018 (October-December), Summer 2019(March-May), and Kharif 2019 (June-August) at three different time intervalsviz., 20, 40, and 60 days after sowing (DAS). For all three seasons, diseaseincidence and whitefly count were recorded for a resistant and susceptiblevariety of blackgram in fields without any vector control intervention. Thehighest disease incidence (87%) was observed in the Panpozhi location during the summer season followed by Vamban and Coimbatore locations. The whitefly count wasmade through both visual count and yellow sticky traps. The whitefly populationwas highest at 20 DAS and decreased with the increasing age of crop for all thethree locations assessed. Molecular epidemiology was analyzed by determininglatent infection of mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) using moleculardiagnosis. Latent infection was found to be well pronounced in the Coimbatorelocation during the Kharif season, where the crop was asymptomatic in both theresistant and susceptible varieties for all the three time periods assessed. The latent infection of MYMV observed in Coimbatore and Vamban ranged from 16.6 to83.3% in both resistant and susceptible varieties for all three seasons. InPanpozhi, the latent infection of MYMV ranged from 16.6 to 66.6% for thesusceptible variety (CO-5) for all three seasons observed. However, in thePanpozhi location, the resistant variety (VBN-8) failed to record any latentinfection.

TI  - Parental knowledge about respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and attitudes toinfant immunization with monoclonal antibodies.
LID - 10.1080/14760584.2022.2108799 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ninety percent of all children are infected with respiratorysyncytial virus (RSV) within their first two years of life. RSV is the main causebehind hospitalization of infants with lower respiratory tract infections. A new monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunization may prevent RSV in all infants. Thiscross-national study aimed to examine parental knowledge about RSV and attitudes to such RSV immunization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on a literaturestudy, a questionnaire was designed and applied in a survey carried out in China,France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the UK, and the US. Eligible respondentswere expecting their first baby or parents of children <24 months old who wereopen to vaccination. RESULTS: Parental acceptance of immunizations relies onperceptions of the preventable disease. In 5627 parents, only 35% reported basic or good level of knowledge about RSV. Recommendation from health careprofessionals and inclusion in immunization programs were crucial to theiracceptance of RSV immunization. If recommended and informed about its efficacyand safety, most parents would accept RSV mAb immunization for their infants.CONCLUSIONS: Infant RSV infections are highly prevalent, yet parental awarenessof RSV is poor. Country variations call for targeted communication about RSV and immunization.

OAB - Almost all children (90%) are infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)before the age of two. Most cases of RSV are mild, but RSV remains the main causebehind hospitalization of infants with lung infections, such as bronchiolitis andpneumonia. A new immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is currentlybeing developed to prevent RSV in infants. While traditional vaccines act tomobilize a person's own production of antibodies to fight a virus, immunizationwith mAbs means that antibodies are given directly. We know that parents'attitudes to childhood vaccination depend on their views on childhood diseasesand vaccination in general. Therefore, we wanted to examine what parents knowabout RSV. How widespread and severe do parents think RSV infection is? Wouldthey like their infants to receive RSV immunization? To answer these questions,we carried out a survey in eight Western and Asian countries. More than 5000people who were either expecting their first baby or already parents of undertwo-year-olds answered the questionnaire. Their responses showed that awarenessof RSV was poor as two-thirds of parents had never heard of RSV or knew only the name. Once exposed to information about a hypothetical immunization against RSVdisease, the immunization was considered beneficial; however, recommendation fromhealth care professionals and inclusion in immunization programs were crucial to the parents' ultimate acceptance of RSV immunization. If recommended andwell-informed about its safety and efficacy, most parents would accept mAbimmunization against RSV for their infants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A correlation between new coronaviruses and host immunity, as well as the role of defective immune function in host response, would be extremelyhelpful in understanding coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pathogenicity, and acoherent structure of treatments and vaccines. As existing vaccines may beinadequate for new viral variants emerging in various regions of the world, it isa vital requirement for fresh and effective therapeutic alternatives. AREACOVERED: Immunotherapy may give a viable protective option for COVID-19, adisease that is currently a big burden on global health and economic systems.Herein, we have outlined three dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines for COVID-19which are in human clinical trials and have shown encouraging outcomes. EXPERTOPINION: With existing knowledge of the virus, and the nature of DC, DC-basedvaccines may be proven to be effective in inducing long-lasting protectiveimmunity, especially T cell responses.

LID - trac074 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/trac074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread respiratory infections with high morbidity rates caused byrespiratory viruses represent a significant global public health problem. Ourobjective was to describe cases and deaths from severe acute respiratoryinfection (SARI) in Brazil over the past 8 y as well as changes in thedistribution and risk of illness and death from SARI before and in the first yearof the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (FYP). METHODS: We performed a descriptive epidemiological study of hospitalized SARI cases and deaths between2013 and 2020 in Brazil, separated into pre-pandemic (2013 to 2019) and FYP(2020). We estimate the increase in SARI cases and deaths in the FYP as well asthe mortality and infection risks attributable to the FYP (MRAP and IRAP,respectively). RESULTS: In 2020, an excess of 425 054 cases and 109 682 deathswas observed, with a significant increase in the risk of falling ill and dyingfrom SARI, with an IRAP of 200.06 and an MRAP of 51.68 cases per 100 000inhabitants. The increase in SARI cases and deaths was particularly prominentamong patients with COVID-19, the elderly, males, those self-identifying as mixedrace and patients with heart disease and diabetes. We conclude that an important increase in morbidity and mortality due to SARI was observed in the FYP. Morevulnerable groups and those living in the Southeast, North and Center-Westregions of the country suffered the most.

TI  - The oral microbiome and lung cancer risk: An analysis of 3 prospective cohortstudies.
LID - djac149 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djac149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested associations between the oral microbiomeand lung cancer, but studies were predominantly cross-sectional and underpowered.METHODS: Using a case-cohort design, 1,306 incident lung cancer cases wereidentified in the Agricultural Health Study, NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Referentsubcohorts were randomly selected by strata of age, sex, and smoking history. DNAwas extracted from oral wash specimens using the DSP DNA Virus Pathogen kit, the 16S rRNA gene V4 region was amplified and sequenced, and bioinformatics wereconducted using QIIME 2. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)were calculated using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Higheralpha diversity was associated with lower lung cancer risk (Shannon index HR0.90; 95% CI: 0.84-0.96). Specific principal component vectors of the microbialcommunities were also significantly associated with lung cancer risk. Aftermultiple testing adjustment, greater relative abundance of three genera andpresence of one genus were associated with greater lung cancer risk, whilepresence of three genera were associated with lower risk. For example, everystandard deviation increase in Streptococcus abundance was associated with 1.14times the risk of lung cancer (95% CI: 1.06-1.22). Associations were strongestamong squamous cell carcinoma cases and former smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Multipleoral microbial measures were prospectively associated with lung cancer risk inthree US cohort studies with associations varying by smoking history andhistologic subtype. The oral microbiome may offer new opportunities for lungcancer prevention.

LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, crowded and unsanitary livingconditions lacking medical expertise made U.S. detention centers hotbeds forinfectious disease outbreaks. There have been 30,000 COVID-19 cases, positivityrates exceeding 50%, and nine deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)custody, but the extent of disease among children under the care of the Office ofRefugee Resettlement (ORR) has not been well-documented. We sought to evaluatethe burden of COVID-19 among unaccompanied minors under the ORR's responsibility.METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 testing results of refugees and asylum seekers infacilities associated with the ORR from 02/01/2020 to 11/18/2020, courtesy of aFreedom of Information Act request. RESULTS: ORR facilities performed 7,132SARS-CoV-2 tests from 3/13/2020 to 11/18/2020. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 positivityrate was 13.4%. Factors associated with higher positivity rates were age group(16 to 17 years old); identifying as male; undergoing testing in April, August,or September; staying in a for-profit versus a non-profit facility, and detentionin certain facilities. The mean detention time with a positive test was 14.8 +/- 3.2 days. Greater than 10 percent of positive tests were in long-term detainees. CONCLUSIONS: The high SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate raises concerns about aninability to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within detention facilities housingunaccompanied migrant children, particularly those run by for-profit companies.Mandated measures for social distancing and vaccination among detainees anddetention facility employees are needed to limit the spread of the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies reported on periprosthetic infection after primaryTHA in HIV-positive patients, but very few showed the results of its revision.OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare primary and secondary clinical outcomes afterrevision arthroplasty for hip joint infection in matched groups of HIV-infectedand HIV-negative patients. METHODS: Using the hospital database, thirteenHIV-positive patients (13 infected hips) and thirteen HIV-negative patients ofthe matched control group (13 infected hips) were identified and their recordswere studied retrospectively. They underwent revision surgery aimed at infection arrest and total hip replacement due to infection developed after primary THA or infected spacers. Harris Hip Score, reinfection rate, limb shortening, anddefinite outcomes were evaluated with Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, and Chi-squaredtests. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Spacers with antibiotics were implanted inpatients of both groups at the first step of revision, except one HIV-infectedpatient who had resection arthroplasty. The mean follow-up was 29.4+/-2.7 and33.+/-2.9 months for the HIV-group and control group, respectively. Threepatients of the HIV-group completed two-stage revision arthroplasty versus tenpatients from the control group. Re-infection rate was higher in the HIV-group.At final follow-ups, the mean HHS was significantly different (53+/-3.2 points inthe HIV-group versus 79.14+/-3.1 points in the control group) along with limblength discrepancy (3.71+/-0.43 versus 1.4+/-0.32). CONCLUSION: Both primary and secondary clinical outcomes of revision arthroplasty for hip joint infection inHIV-positive patients were significantly worse than in the matched group ofHIV-negative patients. Revisions in HIV-positive group resulted in a higherreinfection rate, a small number of definite two-stage revisions, and lowerfunctional scores.

TI  - Exerkine fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 5/irisin-enrichedextracellular vesicles delay vascular ageing by increasing SIRT6 stability.

AB  - AIMS: Exercise confers protection against cardiovascular ageing, but themechanisms remain largely unknown. This study sought to investigate the role offibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin, anexercise-associated hormone, in vascular ageing. Moreover, the existence ofFNDC5/irisin in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their biologicalfunctions was explored. METHODS AND RESULTS: FNDC5/irisin was reduced in natural ageing, senescence, and angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated conditions. The deletion of FNDC5 shortened lifespan in mice. Additionally, FNDC5 deficiency aggravatedvascular stiffness, senescence, oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelialdysfunction in 24-month-old naturally aged and Ang II-treated mice. Conversely,treatment of recombinant irisin alleviated Ang II-induced vascular stiffness and senescence in mice and vascular smooth muscle cells. FNDC5 was triggered byexercise, while FNDC5 knockout abrogated exercise-induced protection against Ang II-induced vascular stiffness and senescence. Intriguingly, FNDC5 was detected inhuman and mouse blood-derived EVs, and exercise-induced FNDC5/irisin-enriched EVsshowed potent anti-stiffness and anti-senescence effects in vivo and in vitro.Adeno-associated virus-mediated rescue of FNDC5 specifically in muscle but notliver in FNDC5 knockout mice, promoted the release of FNDC5/irisin-enriched EVsinto circulation in response to exercise, which ameliorated vascular stiffness,senescence, and inflammation. Mechanistically, irisin activated DnaJb3/Hsp40chaperone system to stabilize SIRT6 protein in an Hsp70-dependent manner.Finally, plasma irisin concentrations were positively associated with exercisetime but negatively associated with arterial stiffness in a proof-of-concepthuman study. CONCLUSION: FNDC5/irisin-enriched EVs contribute to exercise-inducedprotection against vascular ageing. These findings indicate that the exerkineFNDC5/irisin may be a potential target for ageing-related vascular comorbidities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchers to rapidly understand thecapabilities of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and investigate potential therapeutics forSARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 has been associated with devastating lung andcardiac injury, profound inflammation, and a heightened coagulopathic state,which may, in part, be driven by cellular crosstalk facilitated by extracellular vesicles (EVs). In recent years, EVs have emerged as important biomarkers ofdisease, and while extracellular vesicles may contribute to the spread ofCOVID-19 infection from one cell to the next, they also may be engineered to playa protective or therapeutic role as decoys or "delivery drivers" for therapeutic agents. This review explores these roles and areas for future study.

TI  - Enhanced resolution of marine viruses with violet side scatter.
LID - 10.1002/cyto.a.24674 [doi]
AB  - Marine viruses make up an essential compartment of the marine ecosystem. They arethe most abundant organisms and represent one of the biggest sources of unknownbiodiversity. Viruses also have an important impact on bacterial and algalmortality in the ocean, and as such have a major influence on microbial diversityand biogeochemical cycling. However, little is known about the abundance anddistribution patterns of viruses across the oceans and seas. Over the last 20years, flow cytometry has been the technique of choice to detect and count theviral particles in natural samples. Nevertheless, due to their small size, thedetection of marine viruses is still extremely challenging. In this article wedescribe how a new generation of flow cytometer which uses the side scatter (SSC)of violet photons from a 405 nm laser beam helps to improve the resolution fordetecting marine viruses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where virioplankton has been detected in aquatic samples using flow cytometrywith a 405 nm violet SSC instead of a 488 nm blue SSC.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current literature on the psychologicalimpact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer, both in terms of the impact of thevirus itself and of changes in the healthcare system; and to describe currentrecommendations for supporting patients with cancer during the pandemic. RECENTFINDINGS: Multiple studies have shown that patients with cancer experience highlevels of psychological distress during COVID-19. Factors of greatervulnerability have been described as: being young, being female, lowsocioeconomic status, lower educational level, having low levels of hope oroptimism, lower social support, and having cancer with curative intent. Thesevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2pandemic has accelerated thehealthcare digitization process. All departments involved in the diagnosis andtreatment of cancer have made contingency plans to minimize the impact onpatients. SUMMARY: Psychological distress is one of the most frequently occurringsymptoms in patients with cancer during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic hasled to a restructuring of the healthcare system. The paradigm shift may pose achallenge for both healthcare professionals and patients.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has hadshort-term and long-term effects on the delivery of cancer care. Some Europeancountries faced an unprecedented widespread crisis during the first year of theSARS-CoV-2 pandemic, only being able afterwards to gradually recover, thanks tothe improvement in preventive measures, changes in public health and reactiveprocesses in cancer care and a better understanding of the ongoing heathemergency. RECENT FINDINGS: The development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and COVID-19specific treatments, the growing testing and tracking capability to limit virusdiffusion, and research efforts to better define areas of action have all greatlylimited the negative impact of the health emergency on routine cancer care.Theneed to protect those more vulnerable and to ensure continuity of care foroncology patients has been balanced across the pandemic, with the aim toguarantee an optimal standard of care. SUMMARY: This article aims to provide anoverview on the evolving scenario of cancer care throughout the COVID-19 pandemicin Europe, focusing on the particular features that characterized the pandemiccourse as well as the main differences that were observed across it.

AB  - Sindbis virus (SINV) caused a large outbreak in Finland in 2021 with 566laboratory-confirmed human cases and a notable geographical expansion. Comparedwith the last large outbreak in 2002, incidence was higher in several hospitaldistricts but lower in traditionally endemic locations in eastern parts of thecountry. A high incidence is also expected in 2022. Awareness of SINV should beraised in Finland to increase recognition of the disease and prevent transmissionthrough the promotion of control measures.

TI  - Hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children - epidemiological overview of casesreported in Europe, 1 January to 16 June 2022.
LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.31.2200483 [doi]
AB  - Following the report of an excess in paediatric cases of severe acute hepatitisof unknown aetiology by the United Kingdom (UK) on 5 April 2022, 427 cases werereported from 20 countries in the World Health Organization European Region tothe European Surveillance System TESSy from 1 January 2022 to 16 June 2022. Here,we analysed demographic, epidemiological, clinical and microbiological dataavailable in TESSy. Of the reported cases, 77.3% were 5 years or younger and53.5% had a positive test for adenovirus, 10.4% had a positive RT-PCR forSARS-CoV-2 and 10.3% were coinfected with both pathogens. Cases with adenovirusinfections were significantly more likely to be admitted to intensive care orhigh-dependency units (OR=2.11; 95% CI: 1.18-3.74) and transplanted (OR=3.36; 95%CI: 1.19-9.55) than cases with a negative test result for adenovirus, but thiswas no longer observed when looking at this association separately between the UKand other countries. Aetiological studies are needed to ascertain if adenovirusplays a role in this possible emergence of hepatitis cases in children and, ifconfirmed, the mechanisms that could be involved.

TI  - Signalling and responding to zoonotic threats using a One Health approach: adecade of the Zoonoses Structure in the Netherlands, 2011 to 2021.
LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.31.2200039 [doi]
AB  - In the Netherlands, the avian influenza outbreak in poultry in 2003 and the Qfever outbreak in dairy goats between 2007 and 2010 had severe consequences forpublic health. These outbreaks led to the establishment of an integratedhuman-veterinary risk analysis system for zoonoses, the Zoonoses Structure. Theaim of the Zoonoses Structure is to signal, assess and control emerging zoonoses that may pose a risk to animal and/or human health in an integrated One Healthapproach. The Signalling Forum Zoonoses (SO-Z), the first step of the ZoonosesStructure, is a multidisciplinary committee composed of experts from the medical,veterinary, entomology and wildlife domains. The SO-Z shares relevant signalswith professionals and has monthly meetings. Over the past 10 years (June 2011 toDecember 2021), 390 different signals of various zoonotic pathogens in animalreservoirs and humans have been assessed. Here, we describe the ZoonosesStructure with examples from signals and responses for four zoonotic events inthe Netherlands (tularaemia, Brucella canis, West Nile virus, and severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)). This may serve as an examplefor other countries on how to collaborate in a One Health approach to signal and control emerging zoonoses.

TI  - Norovirus Attribution Study: Detection of norovirus from the commercial foodpreparation environment in outbreak and non-outbreak premises.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15761 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Norovirus remains the most significant virological risk that is transmittedvia food and the environment to cause acute gastroenteritis. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the contamination of the commercial foodproduction environment with norovirus will be higher in premises that haverecently reported a foodborne norovirus outbreak than those that have not.METHODS: Sampling of commercial food production environments was carried outacross a 16-month period between January 2015 and April 2016 in the South Eastand the North West of England by local authority environmental health departmentsas part of routine surveillance visits to premises. A total of 2,982 samples,2,038 virological and 944 bacteriological, were collected from 256 premises.Sixteen of these premises, six from South East and ten from North West England,were sampled as part of a public health outbreak investigation. RESULTS &CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 2,038 swabs were submitted for norovirus testing, with anaverage of eight swabs per premises (range 4 to 23) and a median of seven. Of thepremises sampled, 11.7 % (30/256) yielded at least one norovirus positive sample (environmental, and/or food handler hand swab), and 2.5 % of the swabs werepositive for norovirus. A peak in the positivity rate was seen in the South East in April 2016. No associations were found between norovirus positivity andbacteriology indicators, or between bacteriology indicators and hygiene ratings. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates that food premises and food handlers remain a potential source of norovirus transmission and outbreaks.

TI  - Reactive synovitis of the knee joint after COVID-19 vaccination: The firstultrastructural analysis of synovial fluid.
LID - 10.1111/1756-185X.14411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection and the resulting coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) have spread allaround the world since 2019 and have affected millions of people. The developmentof COVID-19 vaccines helped to decelerate the spread of the virus. However, as inthe case of vaccines against other infectious diseases, adverse events can alsopresent with COVID-19 vaccines. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a rare case of a 53-year-old man with knee-joint synovitis, after the first dose of messengerRNA vaccine, with no fever and a negative COVID-19 reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction test. During a clinical examination the suspicion ofpyogenic arthritis was excluded by blood tests and by a complex joint effusionexamination, including a microbiological and cytological-energy analysis of thesynovial fluid. The treatment received by our patient consisted of 3 doses ofdexamethasone administered intravenously over a period of 3 days. All thesymptoms improved after this therapy, and in the 3-week follow-up period werecorded full recovery with no consequences. CONCLUSION: Case reports on patientsundergoing COVID-19 vaccination should be examined in order to detect rare andlong-term side-effects. This is the first report to present the outcomes of anultrastructural analysis of post-vaccination synovitis.

AB  - Herpetic dermatitis and oral recurrent herpes (ORH) are among the most commonhuman infections. Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir (ACV) are used in thestandard treatment for ORH. Despite its therapeutic efficacy, ACV is continuouslyand repetitively administered in high doses. In this sense, the development ofcontrolled release drug delivery systems such as core-shell fibers have a greatpotential in the treatment of ORH. In this work, poly(lactic acid)/poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA/PEG) fibers were produced by solution blow spinning (SBS) for thecontrolled release of ACV encapsulated in the core. PLA/PEG nanofibers containingfour different blend ratios (100:0, 90:10, 80:20 and 70:30 wt%) without or with10 wt% ACV were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The ACVrelease profile for 21 days was accessed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Static watercontact angles of the spun fiber mats were measured by the sessile drop method toevaluate fiber wettability upon contact with skin for transdermal release.Cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy against Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1) wereevaluated using Vero cells. ACV addition did not impact on morphology, butslightly improved thermal stability of the fibers. Addition of hydrophilic PEG inPLA/PEG blends, however, increased drug release as confirmed by contact anglemeasurements and release profile. The in vitro tests showed the effectiveness of the drug delivery systems developed in reducing HSV-1 viral titer, which isrelated to the judicious combination of polymers used in the fibrous mats, inaddition to not being cytotoxic to Vero cells. These results show the greatpotential of PLA/PEG solution blow-spun fibers in the controlled release of ACVto develop practical devices for the treatment of cold sores, while favoring the aesthetic appearance by covering them with a soft tissue patch (fibrous mats).

AB  - In recent years, it has been shown that a combination of different antitumourstrategies involving distinct therapeutic agents, such as chemical compounds and genetic material, could result in an effective therapeutic activity that is much higher than that obtained by conventionally used individual approaches.Therefore, the main goal of this work was to develop a new hybrid nanosystembased on mesoporous silica nanoparticles and polymers to efficiently transportand deliver drug and plasmid DNA into cancer cells. Moreover, its potential tomediate a combinatorial antitumour strategy involving epirubicin and herpessimplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-TK/GCV) gene therapy wasevaluated. For this purpose, various cationic polymers were assessed, includingpoly(beta-amino ester) homopolymer, gelatine type A, gelatine type B, andpoly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride) blockcopolymer. The obtained results show that using different polymers leads tonanosystems with different physicochemical properties and, consequently,different biological activities. The best formulation was obtained for hybridnanosystems coated with PEG-b-PAMA. They demonstrated the ability to cotransport and codeliver an anticancer drug and plasmid DNA and effectively mediate thecombined antitumour strategy in 2D and 3D tumour cell culture models. In summary,we developed a novel silica- and polymer-based nanosystem able to mediate a dual chemotherapeutic and suicide gene therapy strategy with a much higher therapeuticeffect than that obtained through the use of individual approaches, showing itspotential for cancer treatment.

TI  - Adaptations in Vascular Access Procedures as an Initiative to Protect Healthcare Workers Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.1111/nhs.12974 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has led to procedural changes in vascular access services in order toprotect healthcare workers and patients from further spread of the virus.Operational changes made by the vascular access service at a healthcare system inNew York City during the first wave of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in New York City included a team-based approach as well as consideration for types oflines placed to address the increase in patient volume while providing safety to healthcare workers and conserving PPE equipment. The study consists of twosamples of adult inpatients admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC in need ofvascular access. Chi-square tests of independence were utilized to analyze trendsin data. By the fourth wave, usage of shorter life span ultrasound-guidedperipheral IVs increased significantly and the use of longer lasting intravenous catheters decreased significantly between the first and fourth waves of COVID-19.The goals of this paper are to show that with greater knowledge about proper PPE and mindful resource utilization, hospitals are able to become more comfortableand efficient while providing increasingly frequent vascular access services inthe current and future pandemics.

TI  - Barley GRIK1-SnRK1 kinases subvert a viral virulence protein to upregulateantiviral RNAi and inhibit infection.
PG  - e110521
LID - 10.15252/embj.2021110521 [doi]
AB  - Viruses often usurp host machineries for their amplification, but it remainsunclear if hosts may subvert virus proteins to regulate viral proliferation.Here, we show that the 17K protein, an important virulence factor conserved inbarley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs) and related poleroviruses, is phosphorylated by host GRIK1-SnRK1 kinases, with the phosphorylated 17K (P17K) capable ofenhancing the abundance of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) andthus antiviral RNAi. Furthermore, P17K interacts with barley small RNA-degrading nuclease 1 (HvSDN1) and impedes HvSDN1-catalyzed vsiRNA degradation.Additionally, P17K weakens the HvSDN1-HvAGO1 interaction, thus hindering HvSDN1from accessing and degrading HvAGO1-carried vsiRNAs. Importantly, transgenicexpression of 17K phosphomimetics (17K(5D) ), or genome editing of SDN1,generates stable resistance to BYDV through elevating vsiRNA abundance. Thesedata validate a novel mechanism that enhances antiviral RNAi through hostsubversion of a viral virulence protein to inhibit SDN1-catalyzed vsiRNAdegradation and suggest new ways for engineering BYDV-resistant crops.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Throughout and following the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak, there isan urgent need to focus on organizational support strategies aimed at improvingthe resilience of nurses. PURPOSE: This research aims to examine the relationshipbetween the nurses' perceived organizational support and their resilience levels,and to reveal the characteristics that make a significant difference. METHODS:The data of this descriptive and cross-sectional study were collected from 722nurses in February 2021 using the web-based survey method. The study followed theSTROBE guideline. The data collection tools included the Introductory InformationForm, the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support, and the PsychologicalResilience Scale. RESULTS: Nurses were concluded to have perceived a moderatelevel of organizational support and their psychological resilience were found to be higher than average. A positive relationship was determined between theorganizational support perceived by nurses and their psychological resilience.The gender, position/title of nurses, their work experience in COVID-19 treatmentservices, and having been infected with the COVID-19 virus were found to affecttheir perception of organizational support and resilience. CONCLUSION:Organizational support perceived by nurses significantly affects theirresilience. Resilience programs should, in particular, prioritize permanentclinical nurses who are in the risk group in terms of resilience, female nurses, nurses who had been infected with the COVID 19 virus, and nurses who have beenassigned to COVID-19 treatment wards.

AB  - The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known asCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) sparked a global public health pandemic that has impacted every aspect of daily life. Medical research was affected, and many clinical trials were halted to minimize COVID-19 transmission risk and spreadwhile the world navigated this novel virus. Here we describe the relaunch of our virtual reality (VR) pilot clinical trial that uses an in-lab brain and bodytraining program to promote brain health in mid-to-late life older adults, in theera of COVID-19. This case series includes five healthy female participantsbetween 51 and 76 years of age, a subset of a larger VR pilot clinical trial thatstarted pre-pandemic. We developed a revised study protocol based on the Centerfor Disease Control and World Health Organization guidelines to help manage thespread of COVID-19. Since the limited resumption of clinical trials at ourinstitution in August 2020, we successfully completed over 200 in-lab virtualreality training sessions using our revised protocol. During this time, none ofthe five participants or three study staff reported any COVID-19 symptoms orreported a positive COVID-19 test. More than 40 voluntary COVID-19 tests werecompleted by our study staff over the last 6 months. All participants rated oursafety protocol as very satisfied or extremely satisfied and that they would bevery likely or extremely likely to participate in a VR clinical trial during the pandemic. Based on these findings, we suggest that continued VR clinical trialresearch during the COVID-19 pandemic is achievable and can be safely resumed if specific safety protocols are in place to mitigate the risk of exposure andspread of COVID-19.

AB  - The discovery of vaccines for COVID-19 has been helpful in the fight against the spread of the disease. Even with these vaccines, the virus continues to spread inmany countries, with some vaccinated persons even reported to have been infected,calling for administration of booster vaccines. The need for continued use ofnonpharmaceutical interventions to complement the administration of vaccinescannot therefore be overemphasized. This study presents a novel mathematicalmodel to study the impact of quarantine and double-dose vaccination on the spreadof the disease. The local stability analysis of the COVID-19-free and endemicequilibria is examined using the Lyapunov second technique. The equilibria arefound to be locally asymptotically stable if 0 < 1 and 0 > 1, respectively.Besides other analytical results, numerical simulations are performed toillustrate the analytical results established in the paper.

AB  - As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has put the world in an unprecedentedpredicament, thousands of people have died. Data from structured and unstructuredsources are combined to create user-friendly platforms for clinicians andresearchers in an integrated bioinformatics approach. The diagnosis and treatmentof COVID-19 disease can be accelerated using AI-based platforms. In the battleagainst the virus, however, researchers and decision-makers must contend with an ever-increasing volume of data, referred to as "big data." VGG19 and ResNet152V2 pretrained deep learning architectures were used in this study. With thesedatasets, we could train and fine-tune our model on lung ultrasound frames fromhealthy people as well as from patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia. In twoseparate experiments, we evaluated two different classes of predictive models:one against pneumonia and the other against non-COVID-19. COVID-19 can bedetected and diagnosed accurately and efficiently using these models, accordingto the findings. Therefore, the use of these inexpensive and affordable deeplearning methods should be considered as a reliable method for the diagnosis ofCOVID-19.

AB  - Due to their prevalence, respiratory diseases have attained great attention from the historical time. Furthermore, it has been explored in a new dimension due to recent viral outbreaks such as COVID-19. Even though modern medicine treats themajority of respiratory ailments, it is reported that the majority of people(>/=80 %) who suffer from respiratory disorders do not take medication for their conditions, and a considerable number of people still believe in and use herbalmedicines. Herbal therapies have been utilized all over the world for thousandsof years. Traditional herbal treatment has long been seen as a valuable practice in Saudi Arabia, long before modern medicine. Due to its location in the desertand humid climate, Saudi Arabia suffers from a high rate of respiratory illnessescaused by dust, pollens, and viruses. Several published literature have employed different plants and plant products for respiratory problems, but there has yetto be a single, complete study centered on Saudi Arabia. In this review, 41plants were identified, which has complete details regarding their usage intraditional practice for respiratory disorders. A thorough investigation wasconducted and the results were detailed.

AB  - Bidirectional cross-talk between commensal microbiota and the immune system isessential for the regulation of immune responses and the formation ofimmunological memory. Perturbations of microbiome-immune system interactions can lead to dysregulated immune responses against invading pathogens and/or to theloss of self-tolerance, leading to systemic inflammation and genesis of severalimmune-mediated pathologies, including neurodegeneration. In this paper, we firstinvestigated the contribution of the immunomodulatory effects of microbiota(bacteria and fungi) in shaping immune responses and influencing the formation ofimmunological memory cells using a network-based bioinformatics approach. Inaddition, we investigated the possible role of microbiota-host-immune systeminteractions and of microbiota-virus interactions in a group of neurodegenerativediseases (NDs): Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS),Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our analysis highlightedvarious aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response systems that can bemodulated by microbiota, including the activation and maturation of microgliawhich are implicated in the development of NDs. It also led to the identificationof specific microbiota components which might be able to influence immune system processes (ISPs) involved in the pathogenesis of NDs. In addition, it indicatedthat the impact of microbiota-derived metabolites in influencingdisease-associated ISPs, is higher in MS disease, than in AD, PD and ALSsuggesting a more important role of microbiota mediated-immune effects in MS.

AB  - The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the human immune system is at the basis of thepositive or negative outcome of the infection. Monocytes and macrophages, whichare major innate immune/inflammatory effector cells, are not directly infected bySARS-CoV-2, however they can react to the virus and mount a strong reaction.Whether this first interaction and reaction may bias innate reactivity tore-challenge, a phenomenon known as innate memory, is currently unexplored andmay be part of the long-term sequelae of COVID-19. Here, we have tested thecapacity of SARS-CoV-2 and some of its proteins to induce innate memory in human monocytes in vitro. Our preliminary results show that the Spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and the entire heat-inactivated virus have no substantial effect.Conversely, monocytes pre-exposed to the nucleocapsid N protein react tosubsequent viral or bacterial challenges with an increased production ofanti-inflammatory IL-1Ra, a response profile suggesting a milder response to new infections.

AB  - Vaccines can prevent many millions of illnesses against infectious diseases andsave numerous lives every year. However, traditional vaccines such as inactivatedviral and live attenuated vaccines cannot adapt to emerging pandemics due totheir time-consuming development. With the global outbreak of the COVID-19epidemic, the virus continues to evolve and mutate, producing mutants withenhanced transmissibility and virulence; the rapid development of vaccinesagainst such emerging global pandemics becomes more and more critical. In recent years, mRNA vaccines have been of significant interest in combating emerginginfectious diseases due to their rapid development and large-scale productionadvantages. However, their development still suffers from many hurdles such astheir safety, cellular delivery, uptake, and response to their manufacturing,logistics, and storage. More efforts are still required to optimize the moleculardesigns of mRNA molecules with increased protein expression and enhancedstructural stability. In addition, a variety of delivery systems are also needed to achieve effective delivery of vaccines. In this review, we highlight theadvances in mRNA vaccines against various infectious diseases and discuss themolecular design principles and delivery systems of associated mRNA vaccines. Thecurrent state of the clinical application of mRNA vaccine pipelines againstvarious infectious diseases and the challenge, safety, and protective effect ofassociated vaccines are also discussed.

AB  - Background and Methods: The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is the antigenically most distinctvariant to date. As the heavily mutated spike protein enables neutralizationescape, we studied serum-neutralizing activities of naive and vaccinatedindividuals after Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 sub-lineage infections in live virusneutralization tests with Omicron BA.1, Omicron BA.2, wildtype (WT, B1.1), andDelta (B.1.617.2) strains. Serum samples obtained after WT infections andthree-dose mRNA vaccinations with and without prior infection were included ascontrols. Results: Primary BA.1 infections yielded reduced neutralizing antibody levels against WT, Delta, and Omicron BA.2, while samples from BA.2-infectedindividuals showed almost no cross-neutralization against the other variants.Serum neutralization of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants was detectable afterthree-dose mRNA vaccinations, but with reduced titers. Vaccination-breakthroughinfections with either Omicron BA.1 or BA.2, however, generated equalcross-neutralizing antibody levels against all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that although Omicron variants are able toenhance cross-neutralizing antibody levels in pre-immune individuals, primaryinfections with BA.1 or BA.2 induced mostly variant-specific neutralizingantibodies, emphasizing the differently shaped humoral immunity induced by thetwo Omicron variants. These data thus contribute substantially to theunderstanding of antibody responses induced by primary Omicron infections ormultiple exposures to different SARS-CoV-2 variants and are of particularimportance for developing vaccination strategies in the light of future emerging variants.

TI  - Identification of immune-related biomarkers in embryos with neural tube defectsvia a bioinformatics analysis.
PG  - 521
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1273 [doi]
AB  - Background: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are one of the most common types of birth defects. Oral folic acid (FA) prophylaxis is currently available, but thepathogenesis of NTDs is not fully understood. We conducted this study to examine the role of the immune landscape of NTDs and identify novel diagnostic andtherapeutic biomarkers. Methods: We downloaded the GSE33111 data set of 12 NTDembryos and 12 healthy embryos in the same period of fetal development from theGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We compared the healthy embryos and NTDembryos to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also performed a functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs using the clusterProfiler package.We extracted the top 10 ranked genes as hub immune-related biomarkers. We thenused receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine the expressionlevels of the hub immune-related genes and the accuracy of the diagnosis of NTDs.Finally, we analyzed the immune landscape of the NTD embryos and healthy embryos via a single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Results: A total of611 DEGs were identified by the differential analysis, including 95 immune genes.The functional enrichment analysis indicated that Epstein-Barr virus infection,antigen processing and presentation, inflammatory bowel disease, and type Idiabetes mellitus were associated with NTDs. The results of the expression level analysis showed that the hub immune-related genes were more highly expressed inthe NTD embryos than the healthy embryos. Additionally, the ROC curve analysisalso indicated that the expression levels of the 10 hub immune-related genes werehighly accurate in the diagnosis of NTDs [area under the curve (AUC) range,0.708-0.812]. The immune infiltration analysis demonstrated that 20 of the 28immune cell types were more highly infiltrated in the NTD embryos than thehealthy embryos. Conclusions: Immune-related genes are important regulators ofthe occurrence and development of NTDs.

TI  - Establishment of a patient-derived organoid model and living biobank fornasopharyngeal carcinoma.
PG  - 526
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1076 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major challengefor clinicians and scientists. Tumor organoid is a revelational disease modelthat highly resembled the heterogeneity and histopathological characteristics of original tumors. This study aimed to optimize the modeling process ofpatient-derived NPC organoids (NPCOs), and establish a living-biobank of NPCs to study the mechanism and explore the more effective treatment of the disease.Methods: Sixty-two fresh NPC tissue samples and 15 normal mucosa samples werecollected for 3-dimensional (3D) organoid culture. The organoids were confirmedusing hematoxylin and eosin assays. The expression levels of CD133, CD44, BMI-1, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) were detected byimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Recurrent NPCOs were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 6 months and then resuscitated and passaged.Results: We identified a novel two-step enzymatic strategy for the treatment ofNPC and nasal mucosa specimens and an optimal medium for culturing NPCOs andnasal mucosa organoids (NMOs). Organoid cultures were generated from 34 primaryNPC samples, 28 recurrent NPC samples, and 15 normal mucosa samples. The success rates for primary NPCO, recurrent NPCO, and NMO formation were 47.06%, 81.25%,and 86.5%, respectively. All the NPCOs were EBER positive and CK7 negative.Recurrent NPCOs had higher expressions of stem cell markers, including BMI-1,CD44, and CD133. Additionally, recurrent NPCOs could be cultured to passage 4 andfrozen and revived repeatedly, while primary NPCOs were challenging to culture.Conclusions: In summary, we successfully established a living biobank using theNPCO model, which has enormous potential in basic and clinical research on NPC.

LID - 10.3389/fped.2022.919753 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Vaccine response is poor among children living with HIV. The gut microbiotahas been identified as a potential target to improve vaccine immunogenicity, but data are scarce in the context of HIV infection. Methods: Pilot, double-blind,randomized placebo-controlled trial in which 24 HIV-infected children wererandomized to receive a mixture of symbiotics, omega-3/6 fatty acids, and aminoacids or placebo for 4 weeks, each in combination with ART, and were thenimmunized against influenza. Vaccine response and safety of the nutritionalsupplementation were the primary outcomes. Results: Eighteen HIV-infectedchildren completed the follow-up period (mean age 11.5 +/- 4.14 years, 61%female). The nutritional supplement was safe but did not enhance the response to the influenza vaccine. A 4-fold rise in antibody titers was obtained in only37.5% of participants in the intervention arm vs. 40% in the placebo. Noimmunological or inflammatory predictors of vaccine response were identified.Conclusions: In this exploratory study, a 4-week course of symbiotics did notincrease influenza vaccine immunogenicity in HIV-infected children. Largerstudies are warranted to address the potential of modulating the microbiome inchildren living with HIV.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease characterized by immunedysregulations. Different viruses may act as MS triggering agents. MS patientsrespond differently to distinct viruses. The aim of our study is to verify theassociation between the polyomavirus BKPyV and MS, together with otherneurological diseases, through the investigation of serum IgG antibodies against the virus. Sera were from patients affected by MS and other neurologic diseases, both inflammatory (OIND) and noninflammatory (NIND). Control sera were fromhealthy subjects (HS). Samples were analyzed for IgG antibodies against BKPyVwith an indirect ELISA with synthetic peptides mimicking the viral capsid protein1 (VP1) antigens. As control, ELISAs were carried out to verify the immuneresponse against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) of patients and controls. Inaddition, we assessed values for total IgG in each experimental groups. Asignificant lower prevalence of IgG antibodies against BKPyV VP 1 epitopes,together with a low titer, was detected in sera from MS patients and otherinflammatory neurologic diseases than HS. In MS patients and OIND and NINDgroups, the EBV-antibody values and total IgG did not differ from HS.Experimental data indicate that patients affected by neurological diseases,including MS, are poor responders to BKPyV VP 1 antigens, thus suggestingspecific immunologic dysfunctions for this polyomavirus. Our findings arerelevant in understanding the immune reactions implicated in neurologicaldisorders.

TI  - CaFE: A Sensitive, Low-Cost Filtration Method for Detecting Polioviruses andOther Enteroviruses in Residual Waters.
LID - 10.3389/fenvs.2022.914387 [doi]
AB  - Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance has been used to identify polio cases and target vaccination campaigns since the inception of the Global PoliovirusEradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988. To date, only Afghanistan and Pakistanhave failed to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission. Circulation ofvaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) continues to be a problem in high-risk areas of the Eastern Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian regions. Environmentalsurveillance (ES) is an important adjunct to AFP surveillance, helping toidentify circulating polioviruses in problematic areas. Stools from AFP cases andcontacts (>200,000 specimens/year) and ES samples (>642 sites) are referred to146 laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) for testing.Although most World Health Organization supported laboratories use the two-phase separation method due to its simplicity and effectiveness, alternative simple,widely available, and cost-effective methods are needed. The CAFE (Concentration and Filtration Elution) method was developed from existing filtration methods to handle any type of sewage or residual waters. At $10-20 US per sample forconsumable materials, CAFE is cost effective, and all equipment and reagents are readily available from markets and suppliers globally. The report describes theresults from a parallel study of CAFE method with the standard two-phaseseparation method. The study was performed with samples collected from fivecountries (Guatemala, Haiti, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines),run in three laboratories-(United States, Thailand and in the Philippines) toaccount for regional and sample-to-sample variability. Samples from each sitewere divided into two 500 ml aliquots and processed by both methods, with noother additional concentration or manipulation. The results of 338parallel-tested samples show that the CAFE method is more sensitive than thetwo-phase separation method for detection of non-polio enteroviruses (p-value <0.0001) and performed as well as the two-phase separation method for poliovirusesdetection with no significant difference (p-value > 0.05). The CAFE method is arobust, sensitive, and cost-effective method for isolating enteroviruses fromresidual waters.

LID - 10.1021/acsenvironau.1c00047 [doi]
AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has raised great public concern about the airbornetransmission of viral pathogens. Virus-laden aerosols with small size could besuspended in the air for a long duration and remain infectious. Among a series ofmeasures implemented to mitigate the airborne spread of infectious diseases,filtration by face masks, respirators, and air filters is a potentnonpharmacologic intervention. Compared with conventional air filtration media,nanofibrous membranes fabricated via electrospinning are promising candidates forcontrolling airborne viruses due to their desired characteristics, i.e., areduced pore size (submicrometers to several micrometers), a larger specificsurface area and porosity, and retained surface and volume charges. So far, awide variety of electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been developed for aerosolfiltration, and they have shown excellent filtration performance. However,current studies using electrospinning for controlling airborne viruses varysignificantly in the practice of aerosol filtration tests, including setupconfigurations and operations. The discrepancy among various studies makes itdifficult, if not impossible, to compare filtration performance. Therefore, thereis a pressing need to establish a standardized protocol for evaluating theelectrospun nanofibrous membranes' performance for removing viral aerosols. Inthis perspective, we first reviewed the properties and performance of diversefilter media, including electrospun nanofibrous membranes, for removing viralaerosols. Next, aerosol filtration protocols for electrospun nanofibrousmembranes were discussed with respect to the aerosol generation, filtration,collection, and detection. Thereafter, standardizing the aerosol filtration test system for electrospun nanofibrous membranes was proposed. In the end, the futureadvancement of electrospun nanofibrous membranes for enhanced air filtration was discussed. This perspective provides a comprehensive understanding of status and challenges of electrospinning for air filtration, and it sheds light on futurenanomaterial and protocol development for controlling airborne viruses,preventing the spread of infectious diseases, and beyond.

AB  - The existence of precursor lesions for invasive cervical cancer has beenrecognized for more than 50 years. Our understanding of the pathobiology andbehavior of cervical cancer precursors has evolved considerably over the pastfive decades. Furthermore, the terminology used to classify pre-invasive lesions of the cervix has frequently changed. The realization that human papillomavirus(HPV) infections constitute a morphologic continuum has prompted efforts toinclude them within a single classification system, specifically the squamousintraepithelial lesions (SILs) which have now been embraced by the surgicalpathologists. The reduced number of specific pathological categories has madeclinical decision-making more straightforward. The generic criteria for SIL have two important histological parameters: Alterations in the density of superficial epithelial cells and superficial squamous atypia. The flat condyloma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I is generally associated with intermediate andhigh-risk HPV types as against the low-risk viruses that causeexophytic/papillary growth patterns of condylomas. The diagnosis of low-grade SIL(LSIL) (flat and exophytic condylomas) requires first excluding benign mimics of LSIL and second to confirm the characteristic cytologic atypia. For high-gradeSILs (HSILs), the extent and degree of atypia generally exceed the limits of thatdescribed in flat or exophytic condylomas (LSILs). Less maturation, abnormal celldifferentiation, loss of cell polarity, and increased mitotic index with abnormalmitotic figures occupying increasing thickness of the epithelium define a lesion as CIN II or CIN III. Atypical immature metaplasia associated with inflammationand atrophy is a challenge in cervical biopsy interpretation. Careful attentionto the growth pattern of the epithelium, the distribution of the atypia, nuclear spacing, and the degree of anisokaryosis and the presence of enlargedhyperchromatic nuclei help in differentiating a non-neoplastic from a neoplastic process. This chapter describes in depth the diagnostic difficulties in theinterpretation of cervical biopsies. It also provides useful criteria indistinguishing benign mimics from true precancerous lesions and the role ofbiomarkers such as the p16ink4 and Ki-67 in the differential diagnosis ofprecursor lesions and the reactive and metaplastic epithelium.

AB  - Carcinoma of cervix is classified as per the WHO classification into primarytumors which are predominantly epithelial tumors, mesenchymal tumors and tumorlike lesions, mixed epithelial stromal tumors, melanocytic, germ cell, andlymphoid tumors. Secondary tumors are uncommon. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in various morphological forms needs to be separated from other epithelial tumorsfor treatment modality selection. Majority of SCC are human papilloma virus (HPV)positive. The histological pattern, HPV type, and grading do not affectprognosis. Mixed mesenchymal and epithelial tumors are of Mullerian origin. Amongsarcomas, Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma needs to be looked for, as a small biopsy maymiss it. Carcinoma cervix is not the only cancer caused by HPV. High-risk HPV is implicated in causation of various other cancers such as anal cancers,oropharyngeal cancers, vulval cancers, vaginal cancers, and penile cancers.Low-risk HPV viruses similarly cause infections of perianal and genital region inmales and females. The terminology for these lesions has evolved beforeunderstanding of pathogenesis of low- and high-risk HPV. The lower anogenitalsquamous terminology (LAST), an acronym for LAST, incorporates the low- andhigh-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) terminology. In invasivecancers, a superficially invasive SCC is a well-defined entity. LAST outlinesareas where p16 use is recommended. No benefit of addition of other biomarkerslike p63 or ki67 is found in problem-solving in differentiation of HSIL frommimics or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Routine use of biomarkers isnot advocated.

AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmittedinfection in the United States. Persistent infection with HPV can cause variouscancers; however, HPV vaccination can prevent infections associated with highrisk, cancerous strains of the virus. As it relates to HPV, college age men have been identified as one of the catch-up vaccination groups. Among college age men,gaming is an extremely popular extracurricular activity. Further, video gameshave emerged as a popular public health intervention tool. Therefore, this study aims to collect qualitative data on how to develop, implement and evaluate theeffectiveness of a gaming intervention to increase HPV risk perceptions, improve self-efficacy and increase intention to receive the HPV vaccine among malecollege students (18-26 years old). Methods: Four focus group sessions rangingfrom eight to ten individuals were conducted among male college students from onelarge research-intensive university in the South. Using grounded theory, datafrom focus group interviews were coded using NVivo software to identify emergent themes. Results: Participants emphasized that although customization was notviewed as important by college aged males, the ability to tailor in gameexperiences or experience different things each time they played (creativefreedom) was more important. They encouraged that the digital game be created on a mobile platform, incorporate health messages, and be informative to reach theirpopulation. Furthermore, they suggested innovative way to disseminate the game,which included having health department/health care providers prescribe the game to patients as an end of clinical interaction strategy. Conclusions: College age men, are natural avid gamers, enjoy game play, and can engage in learning online or offline. While platform preference varies among gamer type, college age men inour study emphasized that mobile based gaming is the most advantageous way toincrease knowledge/awareness and encourage positive in game behavior which canimpact out of game behaviors such as vaccination. Because of the level of access and natural disposition of mHealth technology seen as an "extension of the self",games for health developers should consider the mobile platform as the ideal for the target demographic.

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus Reinfection in People With HIV in Taiwan After AchievingSustained Virologic Response With Antiviral Treatment: The RECUR Study.
PG  - ofac348
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac348 [doi]
AB  - Background: Data on hepatitis C virus (HCV) reinfection in East Asian people withHIV after treatment-induced sustained virologic response (SVR) are limited.Methods: HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in Taiwan who achieved SVR12 with interferon(IFN) or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) between 2005 and 2021 underwent HCV RNA measurements at SVR24 and then biannually. HCV reinfection was defined as thedetection of different HCV strains beyond SVR12. HIV-negative, low-riskindividuals with SVR12 served as reference patients. Crude reinfection rates and secular trends were assessed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify baseline factors associated with HCV reinfection. Results: A total of216 HIV-positive and 1589 reference patients were recruited, with medianfollow-up durations of 3.0 and 6.0 years, respectively. During a total of 772person-years of follow-up (PYFU), the HCV reinfection rate in HIV-positivepatients was 4.02 per 100 PYFU (95% CI, 2.85-5.65), while the HCV reinfectionrate in reference patients was 0.14 per 100 PYFU (95% CI, 0.09-0.23) during 10862 PYFU. HIV-positive patients had a higher risk of HCV reinfection thanreference patients (hazard ratio [HR], 17.63; 95% CI, 7.10-43.80; P < .001). Nobaseline factors were predictive of HCV reinfection in HIV-positive patients. Theincidence of HCV reinfection in HIV-positive patients increased after 2015, when DAAs were made available in Taiwan. Conclusions: The risk of HCV reinfectionremains high in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with treatment-induced SVR12. Inaddition to mass screening and treatment scale-up, strategies to reducereinfection are needed for HCV microelimination in HIV-positive patients inTaiwan.

AB  - We used human semi-synthetic phage antibody gene libraries to selectanti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD scFv antibody fragment and subsequent characterization ofthis novel tetravalent monoclonal antibody targeting conformational epitopes inthe receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Binding studies suggest that II62tetravalent antibody cross-reacts with RBD protein of SARS-CoV2 and its differentvariants of concerns. The epitope mapping data reveals that II62 tetravalentantibody targets an epitope that does not directly interferes with RBD: ACE2interaction. Neutralization studies with live authentic SARS-CoV2 virus suggests that increase in valency of II62 mAb from monovalent to tetravalent doesn'tperturbate virus interactions with the ACE2 expressing host cells in cytopathiceffect-based (CPE) assay.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads rapidly,causing outbreaks that grow exponentially within a short period beforeinterventions are sought and effectively implemented. Testing is part of thefirst line of defense against Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), playing a critical role in the early identification and isolation of cases to slowtransmission, provision of targeted care to those affected, and protection ofhealth system operations. Laboratory tests for COVID-19 based on nucleic acidamplification techniques were rapidly developed in the early days of thepandemic, but such tests typically require sophisticated laboratoryinfrastructure and skilled staff. In March 2020, Zimbabwe confirmed its firstcase of COVID-19; this was followed by an increase in infection rates as thepandemic spread across the country, thus increasing the demand for testing. Onenational laboratory was set to test all the country's COVID-19 suspect cases,building pressure on human and financial resources. Staff burnout and longerturnaround times of more than 48 h were experienced, and results were releasedlate for clinical relevance. Leveraging on existing PCR testing platforms,including GeneXpert machines, eased the pressure for a short period before facingthe stockout of SARs-CoV-2 cartridges for a long time, leading to work overloadat a few testing sites contributing to long turnaround times. On September 11,WHO released the interim guidance to use antigen rapid diagnostic test as adiagnostic tool. The Zimbabwe laboratory pillar quickly adopted it and made plansfor its implementation. The National Microbiology Reference Laboratory verifiedthe two emergency-listed kits, the Panbio Abbott and the Standard Q, Biosensor,and they met the WHO minimum performance of >/=97% specificity and >/=80%sensitivity. Decentralizing diagnostic testing leveraging existing humanresources became a game-changer in improving COVID-19 containment measures. Task shifting through training on Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) commenced,and testing was decentralized to all the ten provinces, from 1 central testinglaboratory to more than 1,000 testing centers. WhatsApp platforms made it easier for data to be reported from remote areas. Result turnaround times were improved to the same day, and accessibility to testing was enhanced.

AB  - Background: The emergence of the COVID pandemic unfolded a series of precautions and dilemmas and the complete suspension of health services. With the gradualemergence of data showing near minimal effects of the virus on pregnancy,Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) services were gradually resumed following guidelines and advisories. Aim: The purpose of this study was to detect the COVIDpositivity rate in women undergoing ART treatment during the COVID pandemic andcompare clinical and embryological outcomes to the ART cycles performed in thepre-COVID era. Study Setting and Design: This was a retrospective cohort study ofall women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by a fresh orfrozen embryo transfer (ET) between 1st October 2019 and 31st March 2020 (controlgroup) and between 1st April 2020 and 31st September 2020 (study group) at NovaIVF Fertility Clinic, Ahmedabad. Material and Methods: The study group underwent ART during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India and when gradualunlocking of facilities including ART was advised as per the national ARTadvisory by the ICMR in December 2020. The outcomes were compared with thecontrol group (cycles in pre-covid time). Statistical Analysis: Statisticalanalysis was performed in SPSS (v25.0) and included Mann-Whitney U, Fisher'sexact and Pearson Chi-square as appropriate. Values of P < 0.05 were consideredstatistically significant. Results: A total of 367 in vitro fertilisation (IVF)stimulations were initiated. A total of 342 retrievals and 606 ETs (171 fresh and435 frozen) were completed during the study period with a COVID positivity rateof 6.8% (25/367) amongst fresh and 3.9% (18/453) amongst frozen ETs,respectively; the PR and IR in the study group was similar to the control group(47.6 vs. 55.1 P = 0.4 and 68.7 vs. 66.4; P = 0.52, respectively). The maternalcomplication rates were similar in both groups with a COVID positivity rate of10.2% (23/225) and 1 maternal death in the study group. The live birth rates weresimilar. Conclusions: We did not find a noteworthy difference in the clinical andembryological outcomes in the IVF cycles conducted in the COVID era as comparedto the pre-COVID time. Thus, with adequate precautions and safety measures, ARTservices conducted during the COVID pandemic have comparable birth outcomes andcan be safely advocated.

AB  - As the fear of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic subsides,countries around the globe are now dealing with a fear of the epidemicsurrounding the prevalence of monkeypox cases in various regions. Previouslyendemic to regions of Africa, the majority of monkeypox cases associated with the2022 outbreak are being noted in countries around Europe and in the westernhemisphere. While contact-tracing projects are being conducted by variousorganizations, it is unknown how this outbreak began. Monkeypox virus is one ofthe many zoonotic viruses that belong to the Orthopoxvirus genus of thePoxviridae family. Monkeypox cases received global attention during the 1970s,after the global eradication of smallpox. The smallpox vaccine providedcross-immunity to the monkeypox virus. Upon the cessation of smallpox vaccineadministration, monkeypox cases became more prevalent. It was not until the 2003 US outbreak that monkeypox truly gained global attention. Despite the virus beingnamed monkeypox, monkeys are not the origin of the virus. Several rodents andsmall mammals have been attributed as the source of the virus; however, it isunknown what the true origin of monkeypox is. The name monkeypox is due to theviral infection being first witnessed in macaque monkeys. Though human-to-humantransmission of monkeypox is very rare, it is commonly attributed to respiratory droplets or direct contact with mucocutaneous lesions of an infected individual. Currently, there is no treatment allocated for infected individuals, however,supportive treatments can be administered to provide symptom relief toindividuals; Medications such as tecovirimat may be administered in very severecases. These treatments are subjective, as there are no exact guidelines forsymptom relief.

AB  - Identification of epitopes targeted following virus infection or vaccination can guide vaccine design and development of therapeutic interventions targetingfunctional sites, but can be laborious. Herein, we employed peptide microarraysto map linear peptide epitopes (LPEs) recognized following SARS-CoV-2 infectionand vaccination. LPEs detected by nonhuman primate (NHP) and patient IgMs afterSARS-CoV-2 infection extensively overlapped, localized to functionally important virus regions, and aligned with reported neutralizing antibody binding sites.Similar LPE overlap occurred after infection and vaccination, with LPE clustersspecific to each stimulus, where strong and conserved LPEs mapping to sites knownor likely to inhibit spike protein function. Vaccine-specific LPEs tended to map to sites known or likely to be affected by structural changes induced by theproline substitutions in the mRNA vaccine's S protein. Mapping LPEs to regions ofknown functional importance in this manner may accelerate vaccine evaluation and discovery of targets for site-specific therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Background: Aging is a phenomenon universally involving all organisms,genetically determined, and epigenetically influenced by the environment.Numerous observational studies have shown the positive impact ofnon-pharmacological approaches started in younger age on chronic conditionsaffecting the elderly health and survival. This meta-analysis aimed toinvestigate the effect of beta-carotene on the total and cause-specific mortalityas reported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched Medline,Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL Cochrane from inception to September 2021.Studies were eligible if enrolled adults with any health condition, comparedbeta-carotene supplements at any dose with placebo or no intervention, providedinformation on deaths from any cause, and were RCTs, in English. The risk of biaswas assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE. Risk ratios andtheir 95% confidence intervals were used and a P-value less than 0.05 wasconsidered statistically significant. Results: Among 3,942 articles searched, 44 articles on 31 RCTs, which included 216,734 total subjects, 108,622 inbeta-carotene supplement groups, and 108,112 in the placebo or no-interventiongroups, were involved in the final analyses. In a random-effects meta-analysis ofall 31 trials, beta-carotene supplements were found to have no preventive effect on mortality (risk ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.05, I (2) = 42%).Further, the analysis showed no preventive effect on cancer, cardiovascular,cerebrovascular, and other mortality causes. Instead, beta-carotenesupplementation significantly increased the risk of lung cancer mortality (RR1.14, 95% CI 1.02, 1.27, I (2) = 3%) but decreased the risk of humanimmunodeficiency virus-related mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33, 0.92, I (2) = 0).Conclusion: More studies should be performed to better define the role ofbeta-carotene on survival, to confirm or deny our results. Therefore, thepossible beneficial or harmful effects of the beta-carotene supplementation onmortality must not be overstated.

PG  - 951009
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.951009 [doi]
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a serious threat to human life and property. TheIAV matrix protein 2 (M2) is significant in viral budding. Increasing studieshave proven the important roles of host factors in IAV replication. In thisstudy, immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry revealed that the hostprotein tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation proteingamma (YWHAG), which belongs to the 14-3-3 protein scaffold family, interactswith M2. Their interactions were further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation(Co-IP), immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy of virus-infected HeLacells. Moreover, we constructed YWHAG-KO and YWHAG-overexpressing cells and foundthat YWHAG knockout significantly increased viral production, whereas itsoverexpression reduced the titer of virus progeny. Therefore, YWHAG is a negativeregulatory factor during IAV infection. Further, YWHAG knockout or overexpressionhad no effect on the binding, entry, or viral RNA replication in the early stagesof the virus life cycle. On the contrary, it impaired the release of virions atthe plasma membrane as determined using transmission electron microscopy andsuppressed the M2-mediated budding of the influenza virus. Importantly, the H158Fmutation of YWHAG was found to affect interaction with M2 and its budding.Collectively, our work demonstrates that YWHAG is a novel cellular regulator thattargets and mediates the interaction and release of M2.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an infectious diseasecaused by the PRRS virus that leads to reproductive disorders and severe dyspnoeain pigs, which has serious economic impacts. One of the reasons PRRSV cannot beeffectively controlled is that it has developed countermeasures against the host immune response, allowing it to survive and replicate for long periods.Transcription Factors acts as a bridge in the interactions between the host andPRRSV. PRRSV can create an environment conducive to PRRSV replication throughtranscription factors acting on miRNAs, inflammatory factors, and immune cells.Conversely, some transcription factors also inhibit PRRSV proliferation in thehost. In this review, we systematically described how PRRSV uses hosttranscription factors such as SP1, CEBPB, STATs, and AP-1 to escape the hostimmune system. Determining the role of transcription factors in immune evasionand understanding the pathogenesis of PRRSV will help to develop new treatmentsfor PRRSV.

AB  - Human infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus causes severerespiratory diseases. Currently, the drugs against H5N1 are limited tovirus-targeted inhibitors. However, drug resistance caused by these inhibitors isbecoming a serious threat to global public health. An alternative strategy toreduce the resistance risk is to develop antiviral drugs targeting host cellproteins. In this study, we demonstrated that cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4isoform 1 (COX41) of host cell plays an important role in H5N1 infection.Overexpression of COX41 promoted viral replication, which was inhibited bysilencing or knockout the expression of COX41 in the host cell. Theribonucleoproteins (RNPs) of H5N1 were retained in the cell nucleus afterknockout cellular COX41. Strikingly, inhibition of cellular COX41 by lycorine, a small-molecule compound isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants, reduced the levelsof COX41-induced ROS and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase(ERK) in cells, thus resulting in the blockage of nuclear export of vRNP andinhibition of viral replication. In H5N1-infected mice that were treated withlycorine, we observed a reduction of viral titers and inhibition of pathological changes in the lung and trachea tissues. Importantly, no resistant virus wasgenerated after culturing the virus with the continuous treatment of lycorine.Collectively, these findings suggest that COX41 is a positive regulator of H5N1replication and might serve as an alternative target for anti-influenza drugdevelopment.

TI  - Systematic Review on Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Enzootic Cycle and FactorsFavoring Virus Transmission: Special Focus on France, an Apparently Free-Disease Area in Europe.
PG  - 932304
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.932304 [doi]
AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral zoonotic disease resulting inhemorrhagic syndrome in humans. Its causative agent is naturally transmitted byticks to non-human vertebrate hosts within an enzootic sylvatic cycle. Ticks are considered biological vectors, as well as reservoirs for CCHF virus (CCHFV), asthey are able to maintain the virus for several months or even years and totransmit CCHFV to other ticks. Although animals are not symptomatic, some of themcan sufficiently replicate the virus, becoming a source of infection for ticks aswell as humans through direct contact with contaminated body fluids. The recentemergence of CCHF in Spain indicates that tick-human interaction rates promoting virus transmission are changing and lead to the emergence of CCHF. In otherEuropean countries such as France, the presence of one of its main tick vectorsand the detection of antibodies targeting CCHFV in animals, at least in Corsicaand in the absence of human cases, suggest that CCHFV could be spreadingsilently. In this review, we study the CCHFV epidemiological cycle ashypothesized in the French local context and select the most likely parametersthat may influence virus transmission among tick vectors and non-human vertebratehosts. For this, a total of 1,035 articles dating from 1957 to 2021 were selectedfor data extraction. This study made it possible to identify the tick speciesthat seem to be the best candidate vectors of CCHFV in France, but also tohighlight the importance of the abundance and composition of local hostcommunities on vectors' infection prevalence. Regarding the presumed transmissioncycle involving Hyalomma marginatum, as it might exist in France, at least inCorsica, it is assumed that tick vectors are still weakly infected and theprobability of disease emergence in humans remains low. The likelihood of factorsthat may modify this equilibrium is discussed.

AB  - Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle is omnipresent, which causessignificantly economical losses worldwide. The objective of this study was todetermine microRNA (miRNA) and transcript profiles and to establish theirrelationship in response to exposure to the virus. Small noncoding and messenger RNA were extracted and sequenced from serum and white blood cells (WBCs) derived from seven BLV seropositive and seven seronegative cows. Transcriptomic profiles were generated by sequencing RNA libraries from WBC. Bta-miR-206 andbta-miR-133a-3p were differentially expressed in serum (P < 0.05). In WBC,bta-miR-335-3p, bta-miR-375, and bta-novel-miR76-3p were differentially expressed(P < 0.03). There were 64 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). Geneontology (GO) analysis of the DETs overexpressed in the seropositive group withGOs of response to stimulus and immune system process predicted that the DETscould potentially negatively regulate viral life cycle and viral entry or releasefrom host cells. In addition, the DETs depleted in the seropositive group couldplay a role in the downregulation of antigen processing and presentation ofendogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I. The differentially expressed miRNAstargeted 17 DETs, among which the expressions of bta-miR-133a-3p andbta-miR-335-3p were significantly negatively correlated with the expressions ofENSBTAT00000079143 and ENSBTAT00000066733, respectively. Under high predictioncriteria, 90 targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were all non-DETs.The most enriched biological process GO term of the targets was the RNA-dependentDNA biosynthetic process, which could be associated with virus replication. Theseresults suggested that the differentially expressed miRNAs fine-tune most of the target genes in responding to BLV exposure. In addition, Bta-miR-206 interactedwith BLV regulatory genes rex and tax by targeting their coding regions. Afurther study of the miRNAs and the genes may reveal the molecular mechanisms of BLV infection and uncover possible ways to prevent the infection.

AB  - Objective: 1. To determine the prevalence of pre malignant cervical lesions inHIV positive women using conventional Pap smear. 2. To determine the association between various risk factors in HIV positive women and abnormal cytology on Papsmear. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangalore Medical Collegein which eligible HIV-positive women underwent Pap smear, human papillomavirus(HPV) testing and cervical biopsy. Methods: Retropositive women attending gynaec OPD during the study period were taken into the study after taking informedconsent. Women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were subjected to Pap smear. Bethesda system of classification was used for reporting the Pap smear. Womenwith abnormal Pap smear were further evaluated by HPV DNA testing and cervicalbiopsy. Results: Cervical cytology was abnormal in 30% of the HIV-positive women,out of which 10% had HSIL, 15% had LSIL and 5% had ASCUS. Age at first sexualintercourse < 17 years (p = 0.009), past H/O STI (p = 0.0001), women withhusband's having multiple sexual partners (p = 0.0001), women with CD4 count <350 cells/micro-litre (p = 0.0001) were significant risk factors associated with abnormal Pap smear. Conclusion: Invasive cervical cancer is considered apreventable disease because of its long preinvasive state. Therefore, screeningfor premalignant cervical lesions represents an opportunity to prevent womendeveloping cervical carcinoma.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding molecularpathogenesis is an essential factor for the allocation of effective preventivemeasures and the development of targeted therapeutics against COVID-19. Thegenome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes structural and nonstructural proteins, which can be targets for compounds with potential therapeutic ability. On the other hand, the virus life cycle has stages susceptible to targeting by drug compounds. Manynatural antiviral compounds have been studied and evaluated at the cellular andmolecular levels with antiviral potential. Meanwhile, many studies over the past few months have shown that plant polysaccharides have good ability to targetproteins and stages of the virus life cycle. In this regard, in this reviewstudy, the virus specifications and infectious process and structural andfunctional components of SARS-CoV-2 will be reviewed, and then the latest studieson the effect of plant compounds with more focus on polysaccharides on viraltargets and their inhibitory potential on the infectious process of COVID-19 willbe discussed.

LID - 10.1089/ped.2011.0114 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause ofbronchiolitis and viral lower respiratory tract infections in children. It isassociated with annual winter epidemics across the United States, typicallyOctober through April. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of children hospitalized outside the typical RSV season and to compare them with those admitted during the season. Methods: A retrospective chart review wasconducted of all patients who were hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Austin from May 2000 to September 2006 and had a positive RSV antigen test. Descriptive statistics, tests of differences, and associations between patients diagnosed in the off-season versus typical season were conducted. Results: A total of 850charts of RSV-positive cases were reviewed. Of these, 45 patients (5.3%) wereadmitted during the off-season. The following variables were statisticallysignificantly associated with diagnosis in the off-season versus typical season: mean birth weight (2704 g vs. 3204 g respectively, p=0.0001); gestational age at birth less than 36 weeks (OR=4.35; 95% CI: 2.2, 8.6); history of neonatalintensive care unit (NICU) admission at birth (OR=6.04; 95% CI: 2.9, 12.5); andmultiple birth (OR=3.38; 95% CI: 1.2, 9.2). Conclusions: Infants with RSVinfection outside of the typical season were more likely to have been premature, of lower birth weight, the products of multiple births, and admitted to the NICU at birth.

TI  - Surveillance on Adverse Events Following COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccinationin Goa, India: An observational study.
LID - 10.2174/1574886317666220803104438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVISHIELD, ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine was grantedemergency use authorization (EUA) as the first vaccine in India in January 2021. Knowing what to anticipate after vaccination will reduce vaccine hesitancy in thepublic. This study aimed to identify and measure the adverse events followingCOVID-19 vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observationalstudy was conducted at Goa Medical College, starting on February 21 till May 23, 2021. A total of 418 people were enrolled. We collected the data using theMicrosoft Form and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and R-program. RESULTS: Of the 418 vaccine recipients, the incidence rate of AEFI (Adverse Events FollowingImmunization) was 54.31%. Fever, fatigue, and headache were the most commonlyreported systemic AEFIs. Among these, 54.7% of AEFI were mild, 42.38% were of themoderate category, and only 2.96% were of grade 3 severity. None of the AEFIswere severe enough for hospitalization. Most of them developed symptoms within 24hours of the first dose. Complete recovery from AEFIs took a median time of 24hours. CONCLUSION: Most of our study findings were consistent with the phase 1,2/3 trials findings of Oxford-AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 vaccine. The AEFI symptomswere considered immune reactions to the vaccine. The AEFIs were more common amongyounger individuals and females. The chance of missing a serious adverse eventlike a thromboembolic phenomenon cannot be ruled out. We observed low AEFI rates with COVISHIELD in the Indian population compared to Oxford-AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1vaccine in the UK-based population, which can be explained by pre-existingimmunity against adenovirus in the Indian population. However, based on the studyfindings, we may interpret that the COVISHIELD, Serum Institute of India, carriesa good safety profile overall.

AB  - Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are characterized byhyperproliferation of B cells as a result of solid organ or allogeneichematopoietic stem cell transplant. Based on histological findings, it is dividedinto 4 categories. Most PTLD patients are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive.Additionally, aggressive immunosuppressive therapies can also lead to PTLD.Reducing immunosuppressive regimes, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies,chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are available therapeutic options, depending onthe nature and phase of the disease. This review briefly highlights pathogenesis,risk factors, prevention, and therapeutic strategies regarding PTLDs.

TI  - Drop-offs in the isoniazid preventive therapy cascade among children living with HIV in western Kenya, 2015-2019.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) can reduce the risk oftuberculosis (TB) in children living with HIV (CLHIV), but data on the outcomesof the IPT cascade in CLHIV are limited. METHODS: We evaluated the IPT cascadeamong CLHIV aged <15 years and newly enrolled in HIV care in eight HIV clinics inwestern Kenya. Medical record data were abstracted from September 2015 throughJuly 2019. We assessed the proportion of CLHIV completing TB symptom screening,IPT eligibility assessment, IPT initiation and completion. TB incidence rate was calculated stratified by IPT initiation and completion status. Risk factors forIPT non-initiation and non-completion were assessed using Poisson regression withgeneralized linear models. RESULTS: Overall, 856 CLHIV were newly enrolled in HIVcare, of whom 98% ([95% CI 97-99]; n = 841) underwent screening for TB symptomsand IPT eligibility. Of these, 13 (2%; 95% CI 1-3) were ineligible due to active TB and 828 (98%; 95% CI 97-99) were eligible. Five hundred and fifty-nine (68%;95% CI 64-71) of eligible CLHIV initiated IPT; median time to IPT initiation was 3.6 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0.5-10.2). Overall, 434 (78%; 95% CI 74-81)IPT initiators completed. Attending high-volume HIV clinics (aRR = 2.82; 95% CI1.20-6.62) was independently associated with IPT non-initiation. IPTnon-initiation had a trend of being higher among those enrolled in the period2017-2019 versus 2015-2016 (aRR = 1.91; 0.98-3.73) and those who were HIV virallynon-suppressed (aRR = 1.90; 95% CI 0.98-3.71). Being enrolled in 2017-2019 versus2015-2016 (aRR = 1.40; 1.01-1.96) was independently associated with IPTnon-completion. By 24 months after IPT screening, TB incidence was four-foldhigher among eligible CLHIV who never initiated (8.1 per 1000 person years [PY]) compared to CLHIV who completed IPT (2.1 per 1000 PY; rate ratio [RR] = 3.85; 95%CI 1.08-17.15), with a similar trend among CLHIV who initiated but did notcomplete IPT (8.2/1000 PY; RR = 4.39; 95% CI 0.82-23.56). CONCLUSIONS: Despitehigh screening for eligibility, timely IPT initiation and completion weresuboptimal among eligible CLHIV in this programmatic cohort. Targetedprogrammatic interventions are needed to address these drop-offs from the IPTcascade by ensuring timely IPT initiation after ruling out active TB andenhancing completion of the 6-month course to reduce TB in CLHIV.

AB  - Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Ilheus virus(ILHV) are flaviviruses maintained by enzootic transmission networks betweenmosquitoes and birds. They have been detected in South America, with no recordsfor Paraguay. We detected the presence of neutralizing antibodies for SLEV, WNVand ILHV in free-ranging birds collected in Paraguay (2016-2018). Four positivesamples were detected in resident birds: one SLEV (rufous-bellied thrush), oneWNV (barred antshrike) and two ILHV (white-tipped dove and shiny cowbird). These results bring new information about enzootic activity of flaviviruses inParaguay.

TI  - The incidence of TB and MDR-TB in pediatrics and therapeutic options: asystematic review.
PG  - 157
LID - 10.1186/s13643-022-02023-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is considered one of the top 10 causes of deathworldwide and the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent.Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB can affect people of all age groups, includingchildren (aged 0-15 years). However, very little is known about the extent ofthis problem in children. This systematic review aims to investigate theincidence of TB and drug-resistant (DR) TB among the pediatric population. Italso reviews the therapeutic options available to treat the condition. METHODS: Acomprehensive search for all relevant evidence was conducted. The followingdatabases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The searched timeframe was limited from January 1990 to December 2020 with a focus on theincidence of TB and MDR-TB among pediatrics and the therapeutic optionsavailable. RESULTS: A total of 537 articles were obtained via the selecteddatabases. After title and abstract screening, 418 articles were excluded leaving119 articles. Full-text screening was conducted on 119 articles, excluding afurther 110 articles. Thus, 9 articles were subject to quality assessment andincluded in this review. The 9 articles represented the age group of 0-15 yearsand included both males and females. All studies included were of retrospectivestudy design. DISCUSSION: The included studies mentioned a moderate increase inTB cases among pediatrics exacerbated by malnutrition, lack of bacilleCalmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)coinfection. MDR-TB prevalence was especially high in South Africa. Drug therapy for both TB and MDR-TB yielded favorable outcomes among pediatrics. However, one of the biggest challenges with drug therapy includes the dosage forms available. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/G34NF.

TI  - A novel lytic phage potentially effective for phage therapy against Burkholderia pseudomallei in the tropics.
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/s40249-022-01012-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burkholderia pseudomallei is a tropical pathogen that causesmelioidosis. Its intrinsic drug-resistance is a leading cause of treatmentfailure, and the few available antibiotics require prolonged use to be effective.This study aimed to assess the clinical potential of B. pseudomallei phagesisolated from Hainan, China. METHODS: Burkholderia pseudomallei strain (HNBP001) was used as the isolation host, and phages were recovered from domesticenvironmental sources, which were submitted to the host range determination,lytic property assays, and stability tests. The best candidate was examined viathe transmission electron microscope for classification. With its genomesequenced and analyzed, its protective efficacy against B. pseudomallei infectionin A549 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans was evaluated, in which cell viabilityand survival rates were compared using the one-way ANOVA method and the log-rank test. RESULTS: A phage able to lyse 24/25 clinical isolates was recovered. It wasclassified in the Podoviridae family and was found to be amenable to propagation.Under the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, an eclipse period ofaround 20 min and a high titer (10(12) PFU/ml) produced within 1 h weredemonstrated. This phage was found stabile at a wide range of temperatures (24,37, 40, 50, and 60 degrees C) and pH values (3-12). After being designated asvB_BpP_HN01, it was fully sequenced, and the 71,398 bp linear genome, containing 93 open reading frames and a tRNA-Asn, displayed a low sequence similarity withknown viruses. Additionally, protective effects of applications of vB_BpP_HN01(MOI = 0.1 and MOI = 1) alone or in combination with antibiotics were found toimprove viability of infected cells (70.6 +/- 6.8%, 85.8 +/- 5.7%, 91.9 +/- 1.8%,and 96.8 +/- 1.8%, respectively). A significantly reduced mortality (10%) and adecreased pathogen load were demonstrated in infected C. elegans following theaddition of this phage. CONCLUSIONS: As the first B. pseudomallei phage wasisolated in Hainan, China, phage vB_BpP_HN01 was characterized by promising lyticproperty, stability, and efficiency of bacterial elimination during the invitro/vivo experiments. Therefore, we can conclude that it is a potentialalternative agent for combating melioidosis.

AB  - Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most important livestock diseasesrestricting international trade. While African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) act asthe main wildlife reservoir, viral and immune response dynamics during FMD virus acute infection have not been described before in this species. We usedexperimental needle inoculation and contact infections with three SouthernAfrican Territories serotypes to assess clinical, virological and immunologicaldynamics for thirty days post infection. Clinical FMD in the needle inoculatedbuffalo was mild and characterised by pyrexia. Despite the absence of generalisedvesicles, all contact animals were readily infected with their respectiveserotypes within the first two to nine days after being mixed with needlechallenged buffalo. Irrespective of the route of infection or serotype, therewere positive associations between the viral loads in blood and the induction of host innate pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins. Viral loads inblood and tonsil swabs were tightly correlated during the acute phase of theinfection, however, viraemia significantly declined after a peak at four dayspost-infection (dpi), which correlated with the presence of detectableneutralising antibodies. In contrast, infectious virus was isolated in the tonsilswabs until the last sampling point (30 dpi) in most animals. The pattern ofvirus detection in serum and tonsil swabs was similar for all three serotypes in the direct challenged and contact challenged animals. We have demonstrated forthe first time that African buffalo are indeed systemically affected by FMD virusand clinical FMD in buffalo is characterized by a transient pyrexia. Despite the lack of FMD lesions, infection of African buffalo was characterised by high viralloads in blood and oropharynx, rapid and strong host innate and adaptive immuneresponses and high transmissibility.

LID - 10.1186/s12905-022-01916-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. This study aimed to sharethe results of the national cervical cancer screening program performed inprimary health care institutions in Samsun between 2015 and 2019. METHODS: Women aged 30-65 years who were screened for cervical cancer in screening centers ofSamsun between January 01, 2015, and December 31, 2019, were included in thisdescriptive study. The data were obtained from the automation program of the"National Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Laboratory Application" used by theProvincial Directorate of Health Cancer Unit through filtering the completiontime of the tests, and all results were evaluated without sampling. Thus, datawere presented using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The mean age of 89,302women included in the cervical cancer screening program was 45.9 +/- 9.0 years.Of the samples obtained from the participants, 1.0% were determined asinsufficient material, 94.1% as HPV-negative, and 4.9% as HPV-positive. The most common HPV genotypes were 16, 51, 31, and 52. Of the 4337 HPV-positive women,74.7% of the pap smear results were negative (including infection, 36.5%), andthe most common premalignant lesions were atypical squamous cells of undeterminedsignificance in 7.1% and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in 6.9%. HPV 16/18 was also observed in 31.7% of HPV-positive women. Seven hundred ninety-fivewomen were referred to a specialist physician for further examination andtreatment within the scope of the screening algorithm. CONCLUSION: DetectingHPV-positivity by reaching more women within the national cervical cancerscreening program's scope is vital in fighting against this disease. Theeffectiveness of cancer screening programs should be increased by ensuringcommunity participation through awareness activities.

TI  - Neoadjuvant nivolumab + T-VEC combination therapy for resectable early stage ormetastatic (IIIB-IVM1a) melanoma with injectable disease: study protocol of theNIVEC trial.
PG  - 851
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09896-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trials investigating neoadjuvant treatment with immune checkpointinhibitors (ICI) in patients with melanoma have shown high clinical andpathologic response rates. Treatment with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), amodified herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), is approved for patients withunresectable stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma and has the potential to make tumors more susceptible for ICI. Combination ICI and intralesional T-VEC has already beeninvestigated in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV disease, however, nodata is available yet on the potential benefit of this combination therapy inneoadjuvant setting. METHODS: This single center, single arm, phase II study aimsto show an improved major pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, either pCR or near-pCR, up to 45% in 24 patients with resectable stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma uponneoadjuvant combination treatment with intralesional T-VEC and systemic nivolumab(anti-PD-1 antibody). Patients will receive four courses of T-VEC up to 4 mL(first dose as seroconversion dose) and three doses of nivolumab (240 mgflatdose) every 2 weeks, followed by surgical resection in week nine. The primaryendpoint of this trial is pathologic response rate. Secondary endpoints aresafety, the rate of delay of surgery and event-free survival. Additionally,prognostic and predictive biomarker research and health-related quality of lifeevaluation will be performed. DISCUSSION: Intralesional T-VEC has the capacity toheighten the immune response and to elicit an abscopal effect in melanoma incombination with ICI. However, the potential clinical benefit of T-VEC plus ICIin the neoadjuvant setting remains unknown. This is the first trial investigatingthe efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment of T-VEC and nivolumab followed by surgical resection in patients with stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma, with thepotential of high pathologic response rates and acceptable toxicity. TRIALREGISTRATION: This trial was registered in the European Union Drug RegulatingAuthorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT- number: 2019-001911-22 ) and theCentral Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (NL71866.000.19) on 4thJune 2020. Secondary identifying number: NCT04330430 .

TI  - Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) non-specific lipid transfer protein StLTP6 promotesviral infection by inhibiting virus-induced RNA silencing.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1007/s00425-022-03948-6 [doi]
AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: For the first time it is reported that members of the nsLTPprotein family could promote viral infection by inhibiting virus-induced RNAsilencing. Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are a class of solubleproteins with low relative molecular weight and widely present in higher plants. The role of nsLTPs in biotic and abiotic stresses has been studied, but no reporthas shown that nsLTPs play a role in the process of viral infection. We reportthe function and mechanism of the classical nsLTP protein StLTP6 in viralinfection. We found that StLTP6 expression was remarkably upregulated in potatoinfected with potato virus Y and potato virus S. The infection efficiency andvirus content of StLTP6-overexpressed potato and Nicotiana benthamiana wereremarkable increased. Further study found that the overexpression of StLTP6inhibited the expression of multiple genes in the RNA silencing pathway, thereby inhibiting virus-induced RNA silencing. This result indicated that StLTP6expression was induced during viral infection to inhibit the resistance ofvirus-induced RNA silencing and promote viral infection. In summary, we reported the role of StLTP6 in viral infection, broadening the biological function rangeof the nsLTP family and providing valuable information for the study of viralinfection mechanism.

TI  - Directing HIV-1 for degradation by non-target cells, using bi-specificsingle-chain llama antibodies.
PG  - 13413
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15993-y [doi]
AB  - While vaccination against HIV-1 has been so far unsuccessful, recently broadlyneutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein were shown toinduce long-term suppression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy in patientswith antibody-sensitive viral reservoirs. The requirement of neutralizingantibodies indicates that the antibody mediated removal (clearance) of HIV-1 initself is not efficient enough in these immune compromised patients. Here wepresent a novel, alternative approach that is independent of a functional immune system to clear HIV-1, by capturing the virus and redirecting it to non-targetcells where it is internalized and degraded. We use bispecific antibodies withdomains derived from small single chain Llama antibodies (VHHs). These bind with one domain to HIV-1 envelope proteins and with the other domain direct the virus to cells expressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor that isubiquitously expressed in the body. We show that HIV envelope proteins,virus-like particles and HIV-1 viruses (representing HIV-1 subtypes A, B and C)are efficiently recruited to EGFR, internalized and degraded in the lysosomalpathway at low nM concentrations of bispecific VHHs. This directed degradation innon-target cells may provide a clearance platform for the removal of viruses and other unwanted agents from the circulation, including toxins, and may thusprovide a novel method for curing.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05524-5 [doi]
AB  - A new positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) mycovirus, Verticillium dahliaemagoulivirus 1 (VdMoV1), was isolated from two strains (2-19 and XLZ70) ofVerticillium dahliae. The complete genome of VdMoV1 is 2303 nucleotides (nt) inlength and has a large open reading frame (nt positions from 61 to 1938) encodingan RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A multiple sequence alignment indicatedthat the central region of the RdRp encoded by VdMoV1 contains eight typicalviral RdRp motifs. BLASTp analysis demonstrated that VdMoV1 has the highestsequence identity (86.88%) to Bremia lactucae associated ourmia-like virus 2(BlaOLV2). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that VdMoV1 is a new member of thegenus Magoulivirus. As far as we know, VdMoV1 is the first reported member of thefamily Botourmiaviridae infecting V. dahliae.

TI  - Diversity of the nucleic acid forms of circulating HBV in chronically infectedpatients and its impact on viral cycle.
LID - 10.1007/s12072-022-10389-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Besides the prototypical hepatitis B virus (HBV) infectious particle,which contains a full-length double-stranded DNA (flDNA), additional circulating virus-like particles, which carry pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), spliced1RNA (sp1RNA) orspliced-derived DNA (defDNA) forms have been described. We aimed to determine thelevel of these four circulating forms in patients and to evaluate their impact onviral lifecycle. METHODS: Chronic HBV untreated patients (n = 162), included inthe HEPATHER cohort, were investigated. Pangenomic qPCRs were set up to quantify the four circulating forms of HBV nucleic acids (HBVnaf). In vitro infectionassays were performed to address the impact of HBVnaf. RESULTS: Hierarchicalclustering individualized two clusters of HBVnaf diversity among patients: (1)cluster 1 (C1) showing a predominance of flDNA; (2) cluster 2 (C2) showingvarious proportions of the different forms. HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitisphase and higher viral load (7.0 +/- 6.4 vs 6.6 +/- 6.2 Log10 copies/ml; p <0.001) characterized C2 compared to C1 patients. Among the different HBVnaf,pgRNA was more prevalent in C1 patients with high vs low HBV viral load (22.1%+/- 2.5% vs 4.1% +/- 1.8% of HBVnaf, p < 0.0001) but remained highly prevalent inC2 patients, whatever the level of replication. C2 patients samples used ininfection assays showed that: (1) HBVnaf secretion was independent of the viralstrain; (2) the viral cycle efficiency differed according to the proportion ofHBVnaf in the inoculum, independently of cccDNA formation. Inoculum enrichmentbefore infection suggests that pgRNA-containing particles drive this impact onviral replication. CONCLUSION: Besides the critical role of HBV replication incirculating HBVnaf diversity, our data highlight an impact of this diversity onthe dynamics of viral cycle. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Patients were included from a prospective multicenter French national cohort (ANRS CO22 HEPATHER,NCT01953458).

AB  - Cold habitat is considered a potential source for detergent industry enzymes.This study aims at the metagenomic investigation of Tsomgo lake for taxonomic andfunctional annotation, unveiling the deterzome potential of the residingmicrobiota at this site. The present investigation revealed molecular profilingof microbial community structure and functional potential of the high-altitudeTsomgo lake samples of two different temperatures, harvested during March andAugust. Bacteria were found to be the most dominant phyla, with traces of genomicpieces of evidence belonging to archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were noted to be the most abundant bacterial phyla in the coldlake. In-depth metagenomic investigation of the cold aquatic habitat revealednovel genes encoding detergent enzymes, amylase, protease, and lipase. Further,metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to the psychrophilic bacterium,Arthrobacter alpinus, were constructed from the metagenomic data. The annotation depicted the presence of detergent enzymes and genes for low-temperatureadaptation in Arthrobacter alpinus. Psychrophilic microbial isolates werescreened for lipase, protease, and amylase activities to further strengthen themetagenomic findings. A novel strain of Acinetobacter sp. was identified with thedual enzymatic activity of protease and amylase. The bacterial isolates exhibitedhydrolyzing activity at low temperatures. This metagenomic study divulged novelgenomic resources for detergent industry enzymes, and the bacterial isolatessecreting cold-active amylase, lipase, and protease enzymes. The findingsmanifest that Tsomgo lake is a potential bioresource of cold-active enzymes,vital for various industrial applications.

AB  - Human parechoviruses (PeVs) are common viruses that are associated with a varietyof diseases from mild gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms to severe centralnervous system infections. Until now there has not been antibodies forvisualizing parechovirus infection. We used E. coli recombinant PeV-A1-VP0protein as a target in phage display single chain variable fragment (scFv)antibody library panning. Three rounds of panning allowed identification andisolation of several candidate scFv clones, which tested positive inenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against VP0. Three scFv clones(scFv-55, -59 and -71) with different CDR-3 sequences were further purified andtested in ELISA, Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA) against aset of PeV-A1 isolates and a few isolates representing PeV types 2-6. In IFA, allthree scFv binders recognized twenty PeV-A1 isolates. ScFv-55 and -71 alsorecognized clinical representatives of PeV types 1-6 both in IFA and in captureELISA, while scFv-59 only recognized PeV-A1, -A2 and -A6. PeV-A1-VP0 (Harrisstrain) sequence was used to generate a peptide library, which allowedidentification of a putative unique conformational antibody epitope with fullyconserved flanking regions and a more variable core VVTYDSKL, shared between the scFv antibodies. Sequencing of the VP0 region of virus samples and sequencecomparisons against parechoviral sequences in GenBank revealed 107 PeV-A1, -A3,-A8, -A17, -A (untyped) sequences with this exact epitope core sequence, whichwas most dominant among PeV-A1 isolates. These data suggest the first-timeisolation of broad range phage display antibodies against human parechovirusesthat may be used in diagnostic antibody development.

AB  - Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection has primarily been achieved using reverse transcriptase polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) for acute infection, and serology for prior infection.Assay with RT-PCR provides data on presence or absence of viral RNA, with noinformation on virus replication competence, infectivity, or viruscharacterisation. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) istypically not used in clinical virology, despite its potential to providesupplemental data about the presence of viral proteins and thus the potential forreplication-competent, transmissible virus. Using the SARS-CoV-2 as a modelvirus, we developed a fast 'bottom-up' proteomics workflow for discovery oftarget virus peptides using 'serum-free' culture conditions, providing highcoverage of viral proteins without the need for protein or peptide fractionation techniques. This workflow was then applied to Coronaviruses OC43 and 229E,Influenza A/H1N1 and H3N2, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Viruses A andB. Finally, we created an LC-MS/MS method for targeted detection of theeight-virus panel in clinical specimens, successfully detecting peptides from theSARS-CoV-2 ORF9B and nucleoprotein in RT-PCR positive samples. The methodprovides specific detection of respiratory viruses from clinical samplescontaining moderate viral loads and is an important further step to the use ofLC-MS/MS in diagnosis of viral infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care professionals (HCP) were obliged to wear personalprotective equipment (PPE) during pandemic in order to minimize the risk oftransmission of the emerging virus. The objective of the study was to estimatethe prevalence of adverse effects related to the wear of PPE among HCP and todeterminate their predictive factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional studyincluding a representative sample of 300 randomized HCP at Hedi Chaker UniversityHospital Sfax, Tunisia, during the period August-September 2021. Data collection was carried out by an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: PPErelated adverse effects were noted among 87 HCP with a prevalence of 57.2%.Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with PPEadverse effects were female gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.8; p = 0.048), chronic diseases (AOR = 0.29; p = 0.001) and previous infection with COVID-19(AOR = 0.46; p = 0.004). Frequent use of bleach or other disinfection productwithout protection and use of hot water at work were independently associatedwith a high risk of adverse effects ((AOR = 2.22; p = 0.003) and (AOR = 2.83; p =0.005), respectively). Similarly, a duration of use of PPE>4 h per day (AOR =1.98; p = 0.039), as well as use of visors and/or glasses (AOR = 1.84; p = 0.045)were independently associated with PPE related adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Theprevalence of adverse effects related to the wear of PPE was alarmingly highamong HCP. Multiple risk factors were highlighted, notably professional aspects. Adequate and repetitive training for caregivers on the correct use of PPE remain essential to manage this problem.

AB  - Human milk is important for antimicrobial defense in infants and has welldemonstrated antiviral activity. We evaluated the protective ability of humanmilk against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection in a human fetal intestinal cell culture model. We found that, in this model, human milk blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication, irrespective of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies. Complete inhibition of both envelopedMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human respiratory syncytialvirus infections was also observed, whereas no inhibition of non-envelopedenterovirus A71 infection was seen. Transcriptome analysis after 24 h of theintestinal monolayers treated with human milk showed large transcriptomic changesfrom human milk treatment, and subsequent analysis suggested that ATP1A1down-regulation by milk might be of importance. Inhibition of ATP1A1 blockedSARS-CoV-2 infection in our intestinal model, whereas no effect on EV-A71infection was seen. Our data indicate that human milk has potent antiviralactivity against particular (enveloped) viruses by potentially blocking theATP1A1-mediated endocytic process.

TI  - In Utero Ultrafine Particulate Exposure Yields Sex- and Dose-Specific Responsesto Neonatal Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02786 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is associated with lower respiratory tractinfections. The role of ultrafine particles (UFPs, </=0.1 mum) in respiratorydisease is not fully elucidated, especially in models of immunologically immaturepopulations. To characterize the effects of maternal UFP exposure on neonatalinfection, we exposed time-mated C57Bl/6n mice to filtered air or UFPs at a lowdose (LD, approximately 55 mug/m(3)) and high dose (HD, approximately 275mug/m(3)) throughout gestation. At 5 days of age, offspring were infected with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain known to mimic infant infection or sham control. Offspring body weights were significantly reduced in response toinfection in the LD RSV group, particularly females. Pulmonary gene expressionanalysis demonstrated significantly increased levels of oxidative stress- andinflammation-related genes in HD-exposed male offspring in sham and RSV-infected groups. In males, the highest grade of inflammation was observed in the HD RSVgroup, whereas in females, the LD RSV group showed the most marked inflammation. Overall, findings highlight neonatal responses are dependent on offspring sex andmaternal UFP dose. Importantly, infant RSV pathology may be enhanced followingeven low dose UFP exposure signifying the importance of preventing maternalexposure.

TI  - Clinical and Microbiological effects in High-risk Beef Calves AdministeredIntranasal or Parenteral Modified-live Virus Vaccines.
LID - skac249 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jas/skac249 [doi]
AB  - Experimental bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infection can enhanceHistophilus somni (Hs) disease in calves; we thus hypothesized that modified-livevirus (MLV) vaccines containing BRSV may alter Hs carriage. Our objective was to determine effects of an intranasal (IN) trivalent (infectious bovinerhinotracheitis virus [IBRV], parainfluenza-3 virus [PI3V], and BRSV) respiratoryvaccine with parenteral (PT) bivalent bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type I +II vaccine, or a PT pentavalent (BVDV type I and II, IBRV, BRSV, and PI3V)respiratory vaccine, on health, growth, immunity, and nasal pathogen colonizationin high-risk beef calves. Calves (n=525) were received in 5 truckload blocks and stratified by body weight (213+/-18.4 kg), sex, and presence of a pre-existingear-tag. Pens were spatially arranged in sets of 3 within block and randomlyassigned to treatment with an empty pen between treatment groups consisting of:1) no MLV respiratory vaccination (CON), 2) IN trivalent MLV respiratory vaccine with PT BVDV type I + II vaccine (INT), or 3) PT pentavalent, MLV respiratoryvaccine (INJ). Pen was the experimental unit, with 15 pens/treatment and 11 - 12 calves/pen in this 70-d receiving study. Health, performance, and BRSV, Hs,Mycoplasma bovis (Mb), Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), and Pasteurella multocida(Pm) level in nasal swabs via rtPCR was determined on d 0, 7, 14, and 28, andBRSV-specific serum neutralizing antibody titer, and serum IFN-gammaconcentration via ELISA, were evaluated on d 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Morbidity(P=0.83), mortality (P=0.68) and average daily gain (P>/=0.82) did not differ.Serum antibody against BRSV increased with time (P<0.01). There was a treatment xtime interaction (P<0.01) for Hs detection; on d 14 and 28, INT (21.1 and 57.1%) were more frequently (P<0.01) Hs positive than CON (3.6 and 25.3%) or INJ (3.4and 8.4%). Also, INT had reduced (P=0.03) cycle time of Hs positive samples on d 28. No difference (P>/=0.17) was found for IFN-gamma concentration and Mb, Mh, orPm detection. The proportion of Mh positive culture from lung specimens differed (P<0.01); INT had fewer (0.0%; 0 of 9) Mh positive lungs than INJ (45.5%; 6 of13) or CON (74.0%; 14 of 19). Vaccination of high-risk calves with MLV did notclearly impact health or growth during the receiving period. However, INT wasassociated with altered upper respiratory microbial community in cattle resultingin increased detection and level of Hs.

TI  - FGL2-MCOLN3-autophagy axis-triggered neutrophil extracellular traps exacerbateliver injury in fulminant viral hepatitis.
LID - S2352-345X(22)00172-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmgh.2022.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH) is a life-threatening disease,but its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Neutrophil extracellular traps(NETs) were an unrecognized link between inflammation and coagulation, which are two main features of FVH. Here, we aim to investigate the role and mechanism ofNETs in the pathogenesis of FVH. METHODS: A mice model of FVH was established by murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection. Liver leukocytes of infectedor uninfected mice were used for single cell RNA sequencing and wholetranscriptome sequencing. NETs depletion was achieved using DNase1. Acetaminophenwas used to establish a mice model of non-virus caused acute liver failure.Clinically, NETs-related markers in liver, plasma and peripheral neutrophils wereassessed in patients with HBV-related acute liver injury (HBV-ALI). RESULTS:Increased hepatic NETs formation was observed in MHV-3-infected mice but not inacetaminophen-treated mice. NETs depletion improved the liver damage and survivalrate in FVH by inhibiting hepatic fibrin deposition and inflammation. Adoptivetransfer experiment showed that neutrophil-specific FGL2 promoted NETs formation.FGL2 was found to directly interact with mucolipin3 (MCOLN3), which regulatedcalcium influx and initiated autophagy, leading to NETs formation. Clinically,elevated plasma NETs level was associated with coagulation dysfunction inpatients with HBV-ALI. Colocalization of FGL2, NETs and fibrin in liver wasobserved in these patients. CONCLUSION: NETs aggravated liver injury in FVH bypromoting fibrin deposition and inflammation. NETs formation was regulated by theFGL2-MCOLN3-autophagy axis. Targeting NETs may provide a new strategy for thetreatment of FVH.

AB  - Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which are pivotalsensors of RNA virus invasions, mediate the transcriptional induction of genesencoding type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, successfullyestablishing host antiviral immune response. A few excellent reviews haveelaborated on the structural biology of RLRs and the antiviral mechanisms of RLR activation. In this review, we give a basic understanding of RLR biology andsummarize recent findings of how RLR signaling cascade is strictly controlled by host regulatory mechanisms, which include RLR-interacting proteins,post-translational modifications and microRNAs (miRNAs). Furthermore, we payparticular attention to the relationship between RLRs and diseases, especiallyhow RLRs participate in SARS-CoV-2, malaria or bacterial infections, howsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or mutations in RLRs and antibodiesagainst RLRs lead to autoinflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases, and howRLRs are involved in anti-tumor immunity. These findings will provide insightsand guidance for antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies targeting RLRs.

AB  - Abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA) is a complex immunological disease with a strong genetic component, and one of the ten leading causes of death of individuals55-74years old worldwide. Strong evidence has been accumulated suggesting thatAAA is an autoimmune specific antigen-driven disease. Mononuclear cellsinfiltrating AAA lesions comprised of T and B lymphocytes and other cellsexpressing early-, intermediate- and late-activation antigens, and the presenceof antigen-presenting cells have been documented, demonstrating an ongoing immuneresponse. The three components of the trimolecular complex, T-cell receptor(TCR)/peptide (antigen)/HLA have been identified in AAA, and specifically: (i)clonal expansions of T-cell clones in AAA lesions; (ii) the association of AAAwith particular HLA Class I and Class II; and (iii) self or nonself putativeAAA-associated antigens. IgG autoantibodies recognizing proteins present innormal aortic tissue have been reported in patients with AAA. Molecular mimicry, defined as the sharing of antigenic epitopes between microorganisms (bacteria,viruses) and self antigens, maybe is responsible for T-cell responses andantibody production in AAA. Also, the frequency and the suppressor activity ofCD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs and the expression of FOXP3 transcripts and protein havebeen reported to be significantly impaired in AAA patients vs normal donors.

AB  - Viral infectious diseases have various neurological manifestations, whether they are epidemic or pandemic in nature. Nonspecific encephalopathy is the most commoncentral nervous system (CNS) manifestation. The spectrum of nervous evidencevaries for viral pathogens. Some infectious viruses, such as the Ebola virus,exhibit direct neurotropism. Others, such as the Rift Valley fever virus, havethe potential for neurotropism. Direct neurotropism is unknown in monkeypoxvirus, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and even smallpox. As seen in the COVID-19, theremay be evidence of para-infectious neurological syndrome. There have only been a few reports of neurological diseases caused by monkeypox infection. Futureefforts to prevent the spread of infectious disease surges can reduce mortalitycomplications, the therapeutic burden on the health-care system, and preventfurther spread. This study describes the clinical and neurological complications of monkeypox infection, particularly encephalitis, as well as the laboratorydiagnosis of these cases.

AB  - Heterologous vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides arational strategy to rapidly increase vaccination coverage in many regions of theworld. Although data regarding messenger RNA (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 vaccinecombinations are available, there is limited information about the combination ofthese platforms with other vaccines widely used in developing countries, such as BBIBP-CorV and Sputnik V. Here, we assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicityof 15 vaccine combinations in 1,314 participants. We evaluate immunoglobulin G(IgG) anti-spike response and virus neutralizing titers and observe that a numberof heterologous vaccine combinations are equivalent or superior to homologousschemes. For all cohorts in this study, the highest antibody response is induced by mRNA-1273 as the second dose. No serious adverse events are detected in any ofthe schedules analyzed. Our observations provide rational support for the use of different vaccine combinations to achieve wide vaccine coverage in the shortestpossible time.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: As a susceptibility gene for human inflammatory bowel diseases(IBD), how avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog-1 (ETS-1) modulates intestinal mucosal immune response remains unclear. Here we studied the potentialroles of ETS-1 in the pathogenesis of IBD. METHODS: ETS-1 expression was examinedin IBD patients. CD45RB(high)CD4(+) T cell-transfer colitis, dextran sulfatesodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and azomethane (AOM)/DSS-induced colitis-associatedcancer (CAC) models were constructed to probe the function of ETS-1 in vivo.RNA-sequencing of CD4(+) T cells from Ets-1 transgenic (Tg) mice was performed todecipher the key differentially expressed genes. Adenovirus transduction wasconducted to verify the therapeutic potentials of ETS-1 in vivo. RESULTS: ETS-1expression was significantly increased in CD4(+) T cells from active IBD patientscompared with healthy controls, which was upregulated by TNF-alpha but markedlysuppressed by anti-TNF-alpha mAb therapy. More severe colitis was observed inRag1(-/-) mice reconstituted with Ets-1(Tg)CD45RB(high)CD4(+) T cells or in Ets-1Tg mice after DSS exposure compared with controls, characterized by higherTNF-alpha and IFN-gamma expression in inflamed colon. Ets-1 Tg mice were moreprone to develop AOM/DSS-induced CAC, and bone marrow chimeras further provedthat lamina propria immune cells but not intestinal epithelial cells contributed to the development of colitis. RNA-sequencing and luciferase analysis revealedcold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) as a functional target of ETS-1 topromote Th1 cell-driven immune response. Consistently, intraperitonealadministration of adenovirus-m-cirbp-shRNA ameliorated trinitrobenzene sulfonicacid (TNBS)-induced colitis of Ets-1 Tg mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify thatETS-1 is highly expressed in IBD patients and promotes Th1-driven mucosalinflammation through CIRBP. CIRBP may serve as a novel therapeutic target fortreatment of human IBD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The relationship that vaccination against corona virus disease 19(COVID-19) or recovery from the acute form of the illness may have with theincidence or severity of acute appendicitis (AA) has not been explored. The aimof this study was to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A single centreretrospective study of all consecutive adult patients presenting with AA in the 6mo after the initiation of a national vaccination program was performed. Thepresenting characteristics and pathological data of patients who had either been vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19 were compared with those who hadnot. In addition, historical data from the equivalent period 12 and 24 mobeforehand was also extracted. The incidence of AA was compared between each ofthese time-frames. RESULTS: Of the 258 patients initially identified, 255 wereincluded in the analysis of which 156 had either been vaccinated and/or recoveredfrom COVID-19 (61.2%) whilst 99 (38.8%) patients had not. When comparing thesetwo groups, there were no significant differences in the presentingcharacteristics, operative findings or postoperative courses. There was also nosignificant change in the incidence of AA when comparing the study dates withhistorical data (median weekly incidence of AA 8.0 versus 8.0 versus 8.0respectively, P = 0.672). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data presented here, wefailed to find a relationship between a national vaccination program and both thenature and incidence of AA presenting to a busy urban hospital.

AB  - Toscana virus (TOSV) is major meningitis and meningoencephalitis agent in theMediterranean basin. Dogs are frequently exposed to TOSV; thereby they cancontribute to estimating its circulation. In Algeria, little is known about itscirculation, and available data are restricted to the Kabylian region. Toinvestigate the current situation in Algeria, a total of 205 dog sera collectedfrom 13 different wilayas over the country were analyzed by using in-house EnzymeLinked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and microneutralization test (MNT). An overallseroprevalence rate of 20% (14.5-25.5%) was observed by ELISA. Whereas, aseroprevalence rate of 4.56% (1.65-7.43%) was recorded by microneutralizationtest elucidating the exact occurrence of TOSV exposure in dogs, in Algeria.Positive dogs were detected from the areas of Algiers, Bejaia, Blida, Bouira,Medea, Setif, and Tlemcen in the north; Laghouat in the high lands andTamanrasset in great Sahara. Only one serum, originating from Bejaia in the northeast, was positive for both testing methods, while 8/9 positive sera in MNTremained negative in ELISA. MNT negative/ELISA positive result of 40/41 mightsuggest evidence for dog transmission, and circulation of phleboviruses otherthan TOSV. Noticeably, TOSV and antigenically related viruses are largelyprevalent. Thus, they are not only confined to Kabylia region, but are widespreadin Algeria, despite its climate diversity.

AB  - Marburgvirus (MARV), a member of the Filovirus family, causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or post exposuretreatment methods available against MARV. With the aim of identifying vaccinecandidates against MARV, we employ different sequence-based computational methodsto predict the MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes as well as B-cell epitopes forthe complete MARV genome. We analyzed the variations in the predicted epitopesamong four MARV variants, the Lake Victoria, Angola, Musoke, and Ravn. We used a consensus approach to identify several epitopes, including novel epitopes, andnarrowed down the selection based on different parameters such as antigenicityand IC50 values. The selected epitopes can be used in various vaccine constructs that give effective antibody responses. The MHC-I epitope-allele complexes for GPand NP with favorably low IC50 values were investigated using molecular dynamics computations to determine the molecular details of the epitope-allele complexes. This study provides information for further experimental validation of thepotential epitopes and the design and development of MARV vaccines.

AB  - The persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in cells presents a formidablechallenge towards a complete HIV cure. Edelfosine is an FDA-approvedinvestigational, anti-neoplastic drug. In this study, we aimed to investigate itsrole as a HIV-1 Latency Reversal Agent (LRA) using latency model cell lines. Our findings demonstrated that edelfosine reactivated latent HIV-1 viruses in myeloidcells in a dose and time-dependent manner. The mechanism of reactivation byedelfosine involved the activation of NF-kappaB and AP1 pathways in these cells. The reactivated virus was non-infectious. Delineating the mechanism ofnon-infectious virus production revealed an increased stabilization of cellularAPOBEC3G protein as well as its enhanced incorporation into the released viruses.Thus, our study demonstrated for the first time an additional role of edelfosine in reactivation of latent HIV-1 and production of non-infectious virus. Ourresults have paved the way for repurposing of edelfosine as a novel HIV-1 latencyreversal agent.

AB  - For influenza A viruses (IAVs), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) protein wasrecognized to be the key factor to enhance virulence by antagonizing host innate anti-viral responses. However, for the pathways allowing NS1 to regulate the typeI interferon (IFN) response, the identification of the substrates was stillincomplete. Here a recombinant IAV encoding a NS1 containing an affinity tag(NS1-Strep) was generated to capture the NS1-interactome in the lungs of infectedmice. Several scaffold proteins of the 14-3-3 family were distinguished as themost potent candidates. Based on the conserved motif RxxTxxT of NS1, theinteraction between NS1 and 14-3-3epsilon was enabled, which competed for thebinding of RIG-I to 14-3-3epsilon and prevented RIG-I translocation to theadaptor MAVS, consequently inhibiting IFN-beta expression. A recombinant mutantIAV deficient in 14-3-3epsilon binding elicited a markable innate immuneresponses and showed impaired growth kinetics.

TI  - Inhibition of H1 and H5 Influenza A Virus Entry by Diverse Macrocyclic PeptidesTargeting the Hemagglutinin Stem Region.
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.2c00040 [doi]
AB  - Influenza A viruses pose a serious pandemic risk, while generation of efficientvaccines against seasonal variants remains challenging. There is thus a pressing need for new treatment options. We report here a set of macrocyclic peptides thatinhibit influenza A virus infection at low nanomolar concentrations by binding tohemagglutinin, selected using ultrahigh-throughput screening of a diverse peptidelibrary. The peptides are active against both H1 and H5 variants, with nodetectable cytotoxicity. Despite the high sequence diversity across hits, alltested peptides were found to bind to the same region in the hemagglutinin stemby HDX-MS epitope mapping. A mutation in this region identified in an escapevariant confirmed the binding site. This stands in contrast to theimmunodominance of the head region for antibody binding and suggests thatmacrocyclic peptides from in vitro display may be well suited for finding newdruggable sites not revealed by antibodies. Functional analysis indicates thatthese peptides stabilize the prefusion conformation of the protein and therebyprevent virus-cell fusion. High-throughput screening of macrocyclic peptides isthus shown here to be a powerful method for the discovery of novel broadly actingviral fusion inhibitors with therapeutic potential.

TI  - CXCL14 Protects Against Polymicrobial Sepsis by Enhancing Antibacterial Functionsof Macrophages.
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2022-0249OC [doi]
AB  - Rapid and effective control of bacterial infection is critical for the treatment of bacterial sepsis. CXCL14 is an important chemokine involved in infection andimmunity, which can bind to CXCR4. However, the contribution of CXCL14/CXCR4chemokine axis to bacterial clearance in sepsis remains unknown. Here the impact of CXCL14/CXCR4 blockade or CXCL14 administration on sepsis was assessed usingmurine and cell models, as well as human samples. CXCL14 protein levels wereelevated in mice after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. In vivo,CXCL14 blockade using anti-CXCL14 antibody or CXCL14 knockdown byadeno-associated virus carrying-CXCL14 shRNA significantly increased mortalityand bacterial burden, which was paralleled by significantly decreased macrophage influx and M2 macrophage polarization at the site of infection after CLP.Therapeutic administration of CXCL14 improved mortality and bacterial clearanceafter CLP in a CXCR4-dependent manner, and macrophages, but not neutrophils, wereimportant for the protective effect of CXCL14 in sepsis. In vitro, CXCL14directly enhanced bacterial phagocytosis and killing of macrophages, and it also increased phagosome formation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production inmacrophages. Furthermore, inhibiting the activation of PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaBsignaling pathways, but not STAT1, abrogated the enhanced antibacterial effectsof CXCL14 on macrophages. Finally, circulating CXCL14 levels were significantlyup-regulated in the patients with sepsis. CXCL14 could enhance bacterialphagocytosis and killing in human monocyte-derived macrophages, which wasdependent on CXCR4. Therefore, our results indicate a previously undescribed roleof CXCL14/CXCR4 axis and suggest CXCL14 as a potential adjunct therapy inbacterial sepsis.

TI  - Insights into Virus-Induced Immune Mediated Liver Pathology.
PG  - 340-352
LID - 10.33594/000000554 [doi]
AB  - In the context of chronic viral infections, the hepatic microenvironment dictatesthe outcome of the disease by influencing propagation of virus and regulation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell response. Nevertheless, such regulation could bebeneficial as it resolves the disease or could be detrimental as it causes liver pathological consequences. Liver pathology is a hallmark of chronic viralinfection in both human and murine models. Such models show viral infection ofhepatocytes and subsequent direct hepatic damage. Other compelling studies showedthat liver injury was a consequence of overshooting CD8(+) T cells response inexperimental mice, so-called immune-mediated liver pathology. This reviewhighlights the viral-induced immune mediated aspects of liver pathology based on the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Hepatitis virus settings.

TI  - Expanding the tolerance of segmented Influenza A Virus genome using a balancecompensation strategy.
PG  - e1010756
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010756 [doi]
AB  - Reporter viruses provide powerful tools for both basic and applied virologystudies, however, the creation and exploitation of reporter influenza A viruses(IAVs) have been hindered by the limited tolerance of the segmented genome toexogenous modifications. Interestingly, our previous study has demonstrated theunderlying mechanism that foreign insertions reduce the replication/transcriptioncapacity of the modified segment, impairing the delicate balance among themultiple segments during IAV infection. In the present study, we developed a"balance compensation" strategy by incorporating additional compensatorymutations during initial construction of recombinant IAVs to expand the toleranceof IAV genome. As a proof of concept, promoter-enhancing mutations wereintroduced within the modified segment to rectify the segments imbalance of areporter influenza PR8-NS-Gluc virus, while directed optimization of therecombinant IAV was successfully achieved. Further, we generated recombinant IAVsexpressing a much larger firefly luciferase (Fluc) by coupling with a muchstronger compensatory enhancement, and established robust Fluc-based live-imagingmouse models of IAV infection. Our strategy feasibly expands the tolerance forforeign gene insertions in the segmented IAV genome, which opens up betteropportunities to develop more versatile reporter IAVs as well as live attenuated influenza virus-based vaccines for other important human pathogens.

AB  - The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, such as the Omicron variants which arehighly transmissible and immune evasive, underscores the need to developtherapeutic antibodies with broad neutralizing activities. Here, we used theLIBRA-seq technology, which identified SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells viaDNA-barcoding and subsequently single cell sequenced BCRs, to identify anantibody, SW186, which could neutralize major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,including Beta, Delta, and Omicron, as well as SARS-CoV-1. The cryo-EM structure of SW186 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike proteinshowed that SW186 interacted with an epitope of the RBD that is not at theinterface of its binding to the ACE2 receptor but highly conserved among SARScoronaviruses. This epitope encompasses a glycosylation site (N343) of the viral spike protein. Administration of SW186 in mice after they were infected withSARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, or Delta variants reduced the viral loads in the lung.These results demonstrated that SW186 neutralizes diverse SARS coronaviruses bybinding to a conserved RBD epitope, which could serve as a target for furtherantibody development.

AB  - Countermeasures against Zika virus (ZIKV), including vaccines, are frequentlytested in nonhuman primates (NHP). Macaque models are important for understandinghow ZIKV infections impact human pregnancy due to similarities in placentaldevelopment. The lack of consistent adverse pregnancy outcomes in ZIKV-affectedpregnancies poses a challenge in macaque studies where group sizes are oftensmall (4-8 animals). Studies in small animal models suggest that African-lineage Zika viruses can cause more frequent and severe fetal outcomes. No adverseoutcomes were observed in macaques exposed to 1x104 PFU (low dose) ofAfrican-lineage ZIKV at gestational day (GD) 45. Here, we exposed eight pregnant rhesus macaques to 1x108 PFU (high dose) of African-lineage ZIKV at GD 45 to testthe hypothesis that adverse pregnancy outcomes are dose-dependent. Three of eightpregnancies ended prematurely with fetal death. ZIKV was detected in both fetaland placental tissues from all cases of early fetal loss. Further refinements of this exposure system (e.g., varying the dose and timing of infection) could lead to an even more consistent, unambiguous fetal loss phenotype for assessing ZIKVcountermeasures in pregnancy. These data demonstrate that high-dose exposure toAfrican-lineage ZIKV causes pregnancy loss in macaques and also suggest thatZIKV-induced first trimester pregnancy loss could be strain-specific.

AB  - Genes generate transcripts of various functions by alternative splicing. However,in most transcriptome studies, short-reads sequencing technologies(next-generation sequencers) have been used, leaving full-length transcriptsunobserved directly. Although long-reads sequencing technologies would enable thesequencing of full-length transcripts, the data analysis is difficult. In thisstudy, we developed an analysis pipeline named SPLICE and analyzed cDNA sequencesfrom 42 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and matched non-cancerous livers with an Oxford Nanopore sequencer. Our analysis detected 46,663 transcripts from the protein-coding genes in the HCCs and the matched non-cancerous livers, ofwhich 5,366 (11.5%) were novel. A comparison of expression levels identified9,933 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in 4,744 genes. Interestingly, 746 genes with DETs, including the LINE1-MET transcript, were not found by agene-level analysis. We also found that fusion transcripts of transposableelements and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were overexpressed in HCCs. In vitroexperiments on DETs showed that LINE1-MET and HBV-human transposable elementspromoted cell growth. Furthermore, fusion gene detection showed novel recurrentfusion events that were not detected in the short-reads. These results suggestthe efficiency of full-length transcriptome studies and the importance ofsplicing variants in carcinogenesis.

TI  - Assessment of Tennessee's county-level vulnerability to hepatitis C virus and HIVoutbreaks using socioeconomic, healthcare, and substance use indicators.
PG  - e0270891
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), andinjection drug use are syndemic in the central Appalachian states. In Tennessee(TN), declines in HIV among persons who inject drugs (PWID) stalled, and HCVinfection rates increased significantly from 2013-2017. To better targetstrategies to address the syndemic, county-level socioeconomic, opioid use,access to healthcare, and health factors were modeled to identify indicatorspredictive of vulnerability to an HIV/HCV outbreak among PWID in TN. METHODS:Newly reported chronic HCV cases among persons aged 13-39 years in 2016-2017 wereused as a proxy for county-level HIV/HCV vulnerability among TN's 95 counties.Seventy-five publicly available county-level measures from 2016-2017 werecollected and reduced through multiple dimension reduction techniques. Negativebinomial regression identified indicators associated with HCV which were used to calculate county-level vulnerability to a local HIV/HCV outbreak. RESULTS:Thirteen county-level indicators were identified as strongly predictive ofHIV/HCV vulnerability with the statistically significant indicators beingpercentage of the population aged 20-44 years, per capita income, teen birthrate, percentage of clients in TDMHSAS-funded opioid treatment and recovery,syphilis case rate, and percentage of homes with at least one vehicle. Based onthe 13 indicators, we identified the distribution of vulnerability to an HIV/HCV outbreak among TN's counties. Eleven high vulnerability counties were identified,with the preponderance located in east and middle TN. CONCLUSION: This analysisidentified the county-level factors most associated with vulnerability to anHIV/HCV outbreak among PWID in TN. These results, alongside routine surveillance,will guide targeted prevention and linkage to care efforts for the mostvulnerable communities.

AB  - A growing number of organisations, including medical associations, recommend thatresearch subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study. We recently completed a study involving nineserosurveys from 2018 to 2020 in five districts of India among three age groups(children 9 months to < 5 years; 5 to < 15 years of age, and women 15 to < 50years of age before and after the measles and rubella (MR) vaccinationcampaigns). In Palghar district of Maharashtra all individuals in 30 selectedclusters were enumerated, and 13 individuals per age group were randomly sampled.We established the procedures to return the results to the respondents for eachstage of the survey. Of the 1,166 individuals selected for the measles andrubella serosurvey, 971 (83%) agreed to participate and were enrolled.Participants were informed that they will only be contacted if they testseronegative for measles and/or rubella antibodies. Overall, 140 individualsenrolled in the survey tested seronegative for IgG antibodies to measles and/orrubella viruses; were provided the reports and informed to seek medical advice.Upon follow up by phone, 10% (14) of the 140 participants reported to have beenvaccinated. In this paper we discuss the procedures, experiences andconsiderations in returning results to participants in a community-based measles and rubella serosurvey. Although the lessons learned are specific to postmeasles-rubella vaccine campaign serosurvey in India, they might be helpful tothose contemplating sharing results to participants of large scale surveysettings.

AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence ofhigh circulating levels of non-infectious lipoprotein-like HBV surface antigen(HBsAg) particles thought to contribute to chronic immune dysfunction inpatients. Lipid and metabolomic analysis of humanized livers from immunodeficientchimeric mice (uPA/SCID) revealed that HBV infection dysregulates several lipidmetabolic pathways. Small molecule inhibitors of lipid biosynthetic pathwayenzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase, and subtilisin kexinisozyme-1/site-1 protease in HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells demonstrated potentand selective reduction of extracellular HBsAg. However, a liver-targeted ACCinhibitor did not show antiviral activity in HBV-infected liver chimeric mice,despite evidence of on-target engagement. Our study suggests that while HBsAgproduction may be dependent on hepatic de novo lipogenesis in vitro, this may be overcome by extrahepatic sources (such as lipolysis or diet) in vivo. Thus, acombination of agents targeting more than one lipid metabolic pathway may benecessary to reduce HBsAg levels in patients with chronic HBV infection.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are fatal neurological diseases that can be of idiopathic, genetic, or eveninfectious origin, as in the case of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.The etiological factors that lead to neurodegeneration remain unknown but likely involve a combination of aging, genetic risk factors, and environmentalstressors. Accumulating evidence hints at an association of viruses withneurodegenerative disorders and suggests that virus-induced neuroinflammation andperturbation of neuronal protein quality control can be involved in the earlysteps of disease development. In this review, we focus on emerging evidence for acorrelation between NDs and viral infection and discuss how viral manipulationsof cellular processes can affect the formation and dissemination ofdisease-associated protein aggregates.

AB  - Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can infect a variety of cell types by using virions of varying glycoprotein compositions. It is still unclear how this diversity isgenerated, but spatio-temporally separated envelopment and egress pathways might play a role. So far, one egress pathway has been described in which HCMVparticles are individually enveloped into small vesicles and are subsequentlyexocytosed continuously. However, some studies have also found enveloped virusparticles inside multivesicular structures but could not link them to productive egress or degradation pathways. We used a novel 3D-CLEM workflow allowing us toinvestigate these structures in HCMV morphogenesis and egress at highspatio-temporal resolution. We found that multiple envelopment events occurred atindividual vesicles leading to multiviral bodies (MViBs), which subsequentlytraversed the cytoplasm to release virions as intermittent bulk pulses at theplasma membrane to form extracellular virus accumulations (EVAs). Our datasupport the existence of a novel bona fide HCMV egress pathway, which opens thegate to evaluate divergent egress pathways in generating virion diversity.

TI  - Serum N-glycomic profiling may provide potential signatures for surveillance ofCOVID-19.

AB  - Disease development and progression are often associated with aberrantglycosylation, indicating that changes in biological fluid glycome maypotentially serve as disease signatures. The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19)pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)represents a significant threat to global human health. However, the effect ofSARS-CoV-2 infection on the overall serum N-glycomic profile has been largelyunexplored. Here, we extended our 96-well-plate-based high-throughput,high-sensitivity N-glycan profiling platform further with the aim of elucidating potential COVID-19-associated serum N-glycomic alterations. Use of this platform revealed both similarities and differences between the serum N-glycomicfingerprints of COVID-19 positive and control cohorts. Although there were nospecific glycan peaks exclusively present or absent in COVID-19 positive cohort, this cohort showed significantly higher levels of glycans and variability. On thecontrary, the overall N-glycomic profiles for healthy controls werewell-contained within a narrow range. From the serum glycomic analysis, we wereable to deduce changes in different glycan subclasses sharing certain structural features. Of significance was the hyperbranched and hypersialylated glycans andtheir derived glycan subclass traits. T-distributed stochastic neighbourembedding (tSNE) and hierarchical heatmap clustering analysis were performed toidentify 13 serum glycomic variables that potentially distinguished the COVID-19 positive from healthy controls. Such serum N-glycomic changes described hereinmay indicate or correlate to the changes in serum glycoproteins upon COVID-19infection. Furthermore, mapping the serum N-glycome following SARS-CoV-2infection may help us better understand the disease and enable "Long-COVID"surveillance to capture the full spectrum of persistent symptoms.

TI  - WEST NILE VIRUS SURVEILLANCE IN SENTINEL CHICKENS AND MOSQUITOES IN PANAMA CITYBEACH, FLORIDA, FROM 2014 TO 2020.
LID - 10.2987/22-7074 [doi]
AB  - Over 20 years since its introduction, the West Nile virus (WNV) continues to bethe leading cause of arboviral disease in the USA. In Panama City Beach (BayCounty, FL), WNV transmission is monitored using sentinel chickens and testingmosquito pools for presence of viral RNA. In the current work, we monitored WNVtransmission from 2014 to 2020 through weekly serology sampling of sentinelchickens; mosquito populations through biweekly mosquito collections by suctiontraps (1 m and 9 m) and weekly gravid trap collections; and mosquito infectionrates using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.Samples were sent to the Bureau of Public Health Laboratories (Tampa, FL) fortesting presence/absence of WNV via RT-PCR assay. Our results indicated thatcanopy surveillance could augment ground collections, providing greaterproportions of Culex mosquitoes with less bycatch compared with groundcollections. Serology indicated 94 seroconversions to WNV in the study area from 2014 to 2020. The most active year was 2016, which accounted for 32% (n = 30) of all seroconversions reported during the study period. We detected 20 WNV-positivemosquito pools from Culex quinquefasciatus during 2014-17; mosquito infectionrates ranged from 2.02 to 23.81 per thousand (95% CI). Climate data indicatedanomalously high precipitation in 2014-19 preceding WNV transmission. Dataanalyzed herein indicate utility in year-round continuous and diversifiedsurveillance methodologies. This information is needed to properly calibratefuture models that could assist with predicting transmission events of WNV inPanama City Beach, FL.

TI  - Multi-Omics and Artificial Intelligence-Guided Data Integration in Chronic Liver Disease: Prospects and Challenges for Precision Medicine.
LID - 10.1089/omi.2022.0079 [doi]
AB  - Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a significant planetary health burden. CLDincludes a broad range of liver pathologies from different causes, for example,hepatitis B virus infection, fatty liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, andnonalcoholic fatty liver disease or the metabolic associated fatty liver disease.Biomarker and diagnostic discovery, and new molecular targets for precisiontreatments are timely and sorely needed in CLD. In this context, multi-omics dataintegration is increasingly being facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) andattendant digital transformation of systems science. While the digitaltransformation of multi-omics integrative analyses is still in its infancy, thereare noteworthy prospects, hope, and challenges for diagnostic and therapeuticinnovation in CLD. This expert review aims at the emerging knowledge frontiers aswell as gaps in multi-omics data integration at bulk tissue levels, and thoseincluding single cell-level data, gut microbiome data, and finally, thoseincorporating tissue-specific information. We refer to AI and related digitaltransformation of the CLD research and development field whenever possible. This review of the emerging frontiers at the intersection of systems science anddigital transformation informs future roadmaps to bridge digital technologydiscovery and clinical omics applications to benefit planetary health andpatients with CLD.

TI  - High Satisfaction with Patient-Centered Telemedicine for Hepatitis C VirusDelivered to Substance Users: A Mixed-Methods Study.
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2022.0189 [doi]
AB  - Background: While telemedicine may increase health care access for vulnerablepopulations, data are limited on whether people with opioid use disorder (PWOUD) are satisfied with telemedicine. We assessed PWOUD satisfaction with telemedicineand identified factors that increase telemedicine satisfaction. Methods: Weconducted a mixed-methods study among hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected personsenrolled at 12 opioid treatment programs (OTPs) throughout New York State.Participants successfully completed HCV treatment either through telemedicineintegrated into OTPs (N = 238) or through offsite referral (N = 106). Weevaluated Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) response scores at the initialand final health care encounters and subsequently interviewed telemedicine study participants (N = 25) to assess their experiences with telemedicine. Results: Allparticipants (N = 344) successfully completed HCV treatment. We observed nodifferences in PSQ scores between telemedicine and in-person encounters (98.3%and 98.7% of telemedicine participants provided PSQ scores of satisfied or highlysatisfied at each timepoint, respectively). Study participants indicated thatattributes associated with high telemedicine encounter satisfaction included: (1)communicating study information, (2) gaining trust, and (3) deliveringpatient-centered care. Participants weighted "General Satisfaction" and "TimeSpent with Doctor" higher than "Accessibility and Convenience," and femaleparticipants were significantly more satisfied than males. Satisfaction withhealth care delivery among all participants increased significantly comparingtimepoints. Conclusions: Participants were highly satisfied with HCV telemedicineencounters equivalent to in-person encounters. Communication augments trustfacilitating delivery of patient-centered care through telemedicine. Participantsvalue empathy and trust with providers over accessibility and convenience. Insummary, PWOUD are highly satisfied with the facilitated telemedicine model andvalue empathetic and trusting providers. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02933970.

AB  - The NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) COVID-19 vaccine is a recombinant spike (rS) proteinnanoparticle vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant to protect against infection withSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. On July 13, 2022, the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Novavaxvaccine for primary COVID-19 immunization of unvaccinated adults aged >/=18years, administered as 2 doses (5 mug rS and 50 mug Matrix-M adjuvant in eachdose) 3 weeks apart (1). On July 19, 2022, the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of the Novavax vaccine in persons aged >/=18 years for the prevention of COVID-19.* In theper-protocol(dagger) efficacy analysis, vaccine efficacy (VE) against reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19was 89.6% (95% CI = 82.4%-93.8%). The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 wasthe predominant circulating variant during the period of case accrual for VEassessments. Cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in temporalassociation with vaccination, suggesting a possible causal relationship. The ACIPrecommendation for the use of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is interim and will beupdated as additional information becomes available. The adjuvanted, proteinsubunit-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine provides an additional option forunvaccinated adults, increasing flexibility for the public and for vaccineproviders. Vaccination is important for protection against COVID-19.

AB  - Post-COVID-19 (post-COVID) symptoms and conditions* are new, recurring, orongoing health problems that occur 4 or more weeks after infection withSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Previous studies have characterized and estimated the incidence of post-COVID conditions among adults (1,2), but dataamong children and adolescents are limited (3-8). Using a large medical claimsdatabase, CDC assessed nine potential post-COVID signs and symptoms (symptoms)and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among 781,419 U.S. children andadolescents aged 0-17 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (patients withCOVID-19) compared with 2,344,257 U.S. children and adolescents withoutrecognized COVID-19 (patients without COVID-19) during March 1, 2020-January 31, 2022. The analysis identified several symptoms and conditions with elevatedadjusted hazard ratios among patients with COVID-19 (compared with thosewithout). The highest hazard ratios were recorded for acute pulmonary embolism(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99),venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32),and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this studypopulation. Conversely, symptoms and conditions that were most common in thisstudy population had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were patients without to experience respiratory signs andsymptoms, symptoms of mental conditions, muscle disorders, neurologicalconditions, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, and sleepingdisorders. COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligiblechildren and adolescents, are critical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection andsubsequent illness, including post-COVID symptoms and conditions (9).

TI  - Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns and Guideline Concordance for UncomplicatedUrinary Tract Infections Among Adult Women in the US Military Health System.
PG  - e2225730
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25730 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most commonlydiagnosed infections, and prior studies have reported discordance in antibiotictreatment with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.Objective: To assess IDSA guideline concordance rates for women withuncomplicated UTIs treated with antibiotics, and compare concordance ratesbetween different specialty field. Design, Setting, and Participants:Retrospective cross-sectional study of health care claims data from the USMilitary Health System Data Repository, which contains comprehensive health care encounter and claims data for all military beneficiaries. Participants were adultwomen between the ages of 18 to 50 years with uncomplicated UTIs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. Data extraction and analysis were performed in 2022.Patients with diagnosis of UTI in the preceding 6 months, current pregnancy,history of pyelonephritis, history of diabetes, history of organ transplant,history of human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, urinary tract abnormalities, or history of urologic procedures were excluded.Exposures: Antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated UTIs. Only antibiotics receivedwithin 1 day after the diagnosis were analyzed. The IDSA recommends the followingantibiotics as first-line therapy: nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,fosfomycin, pivmecillinam. Main Outcomes and Measures: The IDSA guidelineconcordance rates were calculated as the number of patients receiving first-line antibiotic therapy divided by the total number of cases for uncomplicated UTIs.Results: A total of 46793 adult women (67.3% [31475 of 46793] aged 18-34 years;38.2% [31475 of 46793] of White race) were diagnosed with uncomplicated UTIs with91.0% receiving guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment. In comparison withobstetrics and gynecology, IDSA guideline-concordant treatment was more likely ininternal medicine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.87; 95% CI, 2.73-3.03), familymedicine (aOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.76-1.87), surgery (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.36-1.67), and emergency medicine (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.32-1.39) and less likely in urology (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.38-0.43). Compared with direct military care, privatesector care had lower concordance rates (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62-0.64).Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of antibiotic treatmentsfor uncomplicated UTIs in a universally insured population, the IDSAguideline-concordance rate was high at 91.0% with higher rates in direct militarycare compared with private sector care. There were higher rates in generalmedical specialties, surgery, and emergency medicine and lower rates in urologyand obstetrics and gynecology. These results further enhance the literature oncurrent antibiotic prescribing practices for uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.

LID - 10.1097/DAD.0000000000002259 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: We report a case of mycosis fungoides (MF) in an 18-year-old man whose neoplastic T cells expressed CD4, CD8, and CD56, with no evidence of TCR-delta orEpstein-Barr virus (EBER) expression. Clinically, neither hypopigmentation norhyperpigmentation nor poikilodermatous skin lesions were present, and the lesionssubsided with oral corticoids and retinoids and environmental solar ultravioletexposure. Our case represents the oldest patient reported so far withnonpoikilodermatous, CD8/CD56 MF and adds to the phenotypic diversity of MF inthe pediatric population. This distinct phenotype does not seem to be linked to amore aggressive course than the classic CD-4 positive one.

TI  - First detection of Lake Sinai virus in the Czech Republic: a potential member of a new species.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05548-x [doi]
AB  - Lake Sinai virus (LSV) is one of over 20 honey bee viruses. Variants of LSV have been classified as members of two officially recognised species, Lake Sinai virus1 and Lake Sinai virus 2. However, there are currently a limited number ofwhole-genome sequences, and the genetic variability of the virus indicates thatadditional species may need to be established. Extracted nucleic acid of 209honey bee samples was screened by PCR for 11 honey bee viruses. LSV was the thirdmost abundant virus (36.9% of positive samples), after Apis mellifera filamentousvirus (72.2%) and deformed wing virus (52.5%). LSV-positive samples were analyzedfurther by PCR with primers targeting the region encoding the viral RNA-dependentRNA polymerase. Subsequently, the PCR products were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were used for a first round of phylogenetic analysis. Based on thoseresults, several isolates were selected for whole-genome sequencing, and thecomplete genome sequences were used for additional phylogenetic analysis. Theresults indicated the presence of at least three genetically distinct groups ofLSV in the Czech Republic, the most prevalent one being related to LSV 2 but too dissimilar to be considered a member of the same species. Two sequences of amajor LSV strain cluster native to the Czech Republic were determined,representing the first Czech LSV strains published to date.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05539-y [doi]
AB  - The complete genome sequence of a virus from lily (Lilium lancifolium Thunb.)growing in Huoshan County, Anhui Province, China, was determined. The wholegenome consists of 9558 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tail, and encodes a3061-amino-acid polyprotein (GenBank number ON365558) typical of potyviruses.This is the first complete genome sequence of iris potyvirus B (IPB), for whichonly a partial sequence from Iris domestica was reported previously. Comparative analysis of this genome sequence with those of closely related potyvirusesidentified nine cleavage sites and the conserved motifs typical of potyviruses.The complete polyprotein ORF shares 73.6% nucleotide and 81.6% amino acidsequence identity with that of iris potyvirus A (IPA, GenBank number MH898493).Phylogenetic analysis showed that IPB is related to IPA and clusters in a groupwith lily yellow mosaic virus (LYMV). This is the first report of IPB infectinglily plants.

AB  - Epstein-Barr-virus-associated lymphoproliferations (EBV-LPD) constitute a widespectrum from benign, self-limiting lymphoproliferations to malignant lymphoma.Because of the clinical and morphological heterogeneity of EBV-LPD and the highprevalence of EBV infections, knowledge of the diagnostic criteria is of greatimportance for the practice of diagnostic pathology. In this review, clinical andpathological characteristics of the non-malignant EBV-related LPD in patientswith and without immunosuppression are presented and their current classificationis discussed.EBV-LPD can be of Bcell or T/NK-cell origin. Identification of EBVlatency type and information about possible (iatrogenic) immunodeficiency of the patient are critical for diagnostic evaluation and separation from malignantlymphoma. The clinical context and the detection of EBV in T and NK-cells areboth essential for the diagnosis of EBV+ T/NK-cell LPD, which are rare inEuropean countries.

AB  - The human body comprises around 600 lymph nodes as constituents of adecentralized and dispersed immune system. The main task of lymph nodes iscleaning the lymph fluid and defending the organism against outer and innerthreats by bacteria, viruses and tumour cells. The histologic picture of lymphnodes reflects the different strategies of the innate and adaptive immune system,which allocates antigen presenting cells, macrophages, B and Tcell systems andreticulum cells. However, the histological picture, without any additionalinvestigations, usually only allows speculation about the causative agent liketoxoplasmosis, other bacteria or viruses. This chapter describes different lymph node reactions in detail in order to obtain a better understanding of specificimmune reactions allowing a precise diagnosis and a reliable distinction frommalignant processes. The last issue in particular is one of the main tasks ofhaematopathology. In addition to these known principles, we try to integrateresults obtained with the new method of three-dimensional (3D) microscopy offixed lymphoid tissue. At first glance, this seems to be unusual. Nevertheless,we try to apply this approach, since 3D visualization of morphological detailsprovides distinct cellular details as well as new interpretations of cell-cellinteractions and the functions of lymphoid compartments, like germinal centresand Tzones.

TI  - Human Adenovirus Type 26 Infection Mediated by alphavbeta3 Integrin IsCaveolin-1-Dependent.
PG  - e0109722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01097-22 [doi]
AB  - Human adenovirus type 26 (HAdV26) has been recognized as a promising platform forvaccine vector development, and very recently vaccine against COVID-19 based onHAdV26 was authorized for emergency use. Nevertheless, basic biology of thisvirus, namely, pathway which HAdV26 uses to enter the cell, is stillinsufficiently known. We have shown here that HAdV26 infection of humanepithelial cells expressing low amount of alphavbeta3 integrin involves clathrin and is caveolin-1-independent, while HAdV26 infection of cells with high amountof alphavbeta3 integrin does not involve clathrin but is caveolin-1-dependent.Thus, this study demonstrates that caveolin-1 is limiting factor in alphavbeta3integrin-mediated HAdV26 infection. Regardless of alphavbeta3 integrinexpression, HAdV26 infection involves dynamin-2. Our data provide for thefirst-time description of HAdV26 cell entry pathway, hence increase our knowledgeof HAdV26 infection. Knowing that functionality of adenovirus vector isinfluenced by its cell entry pathway and intracellular trafficking, our resultswill contribute to better understanding of HAdV26 immunogenicity and antigenpresentation when used as vaccine vector. IMPORTANCE In order to fulfill its roleas a vector, adenovirus needs to successfully deliver its DNA genome to the host nucleus, a process highly influenced by adenovirus intracellular translocation.Thus, cell entry pathway and intracellular trafficking determine functionality ofhuman adenovirus-based vectors. Endocytosis of HAdV26, currently extensivelystudied as a vaccine vector, has not been described so far. We present here that HAdV26 infection of human epithelial cells with high expression of alphavbeta3integrin, one of the putative HAdV26 receptors, is caveolin-1- and partiallydynamin-2-dependent. Since caveolin containing domains provide a uniqueenvironment for specific signaling events and participate in inflammatorysignaling one can imagine that directing HAdV26 cell entry towardcaveolin-1-mediate pathway might play role in immunogenicity of this virus.Therefore, our results contribute to better understanding of HAdV26 infectionpathway, hence, can be helpful in explaining induction of immune response andantigen presentation by HAdV26-based vaccine vector.

LID - 10.1128/jvi.00421-22 [doi]
AB  - Weeds surrounding crops may act as alternative hosts, playing importantepidemiological roles as virus reservoirs and impacting virus evolution. We used high-throughput sequencing to identify viruses in Spanish melon crops and plants belonging to three pluriannual weed species, Ecballium elaterium, Malvasylvestris, and Solanum nigrum, sampled at the edges of the crops. Melon and E.elaterium, both belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae, shared three virusspecies, whereas there was no virus species overlap between melon and the othertwo weeds. The diversity of cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV) and tomatoleaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), both in melon and E. elaterium, was further studied by amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic and population genetics analysesshowed that the CABYV population was structured by the host, identifying threesites in the CABYV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase under positive selection, perhapsreflecting host adaptation. The ToLCNDV population was much less diverse than theCABYV one, likely as a consequence of the relatively recent introduction ofToLCNDV in Spain. In spite of its low diversity, we identified geographical butno host differentiation for ToLCNDV. Potential virus migration fluxes between E. elaterium and melon plants were also analyzed. For CABYV, no evidence ofmigration between the populations of the two hosts was found, whereas importantfluxes were identified between geographically distant subpopulations for eachhost. For ToLCNDV, in contrast, evidence of migration from melon to E. elaterium was found, but not the other way around. IMPORTANCE It has been reported thatabout half of the emerging diseases affecting plants are caused by viruses.Alternative hosts often play critical roles in virus emergence as virusreservoirs, bridging host species that are otherwise unconnected and/or favoring virus diversification. In spite of this, the viromes of potential alternativehosts remain largely unexplored. In the case of crops, pluriannual weeds at thecrop edges may play these roles. Here, we took advantage of the power ofhigh-throughput sequencing to characterize the viromes of three weed speciesfrequently found at the edges of melon crops. We identified three viruses shared by melon and the cucurbit weed, with two of them being epidemiologically relevantfor melon crops. Further genetic analyses showed that these two viruses hadcontrasting patterns of diversification and migration, providing an interestingexample on the role that weeds may play in the ecology and evolution of virusesaffecting crops.

TI  - Rotavirus VP4 Epitope of a Broadly Neutralizing Human Antibody Defined by ItsStructure Bound with an Attenuated-Strain Virion.
PG  - e0062722
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00627-22 [doi]
AB  - Rotavirus live-attenuated vaccines, both mono- and pentavalent, generate broadly heterotypic protection. B-cells isolated from adults encode neutralizingantibodies, some with affinity for VP5*, that afford broad protection in mice. Wehave mapped the epitope of one such antibody by determining the high-resolutioncryo-EM structure of its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) bound to the virion of a candidate vaccine strain, CDC-9. The Fab contacts both the distal end of a VP5*beta-barrel domain and the two VP8* lectin-like domains at the tip of aprojecting spike. Its interactions with VP8* do not impinge on the likelyreceptor-binding site, suggesting that the mechanism of neutralization is at astep subsequent to initial attachment. We also examined structures of CDC-9virions from two different stages of serial passaging. Nearly all the VP4(cleaved to VP8*/VP5*) spikes on particles from the earlier passage (wild-typeisolate) had transitioned from the "upright" conformation present on fullyinfectious virions to the "reversed" conformation that is probably the end state of membrane insertion, unable to mediate penetration, consistent with the verylow in vitro infectivity of the wild-type isolate. About half the VP4 spikes wereupright on particles from the later passage, which had recovered substantial invitro infectivity but had acquired an attenuated phenotype in neonatal rats. Amutation in VP4 that occurred during passaging appears to stabilize the interfaceat the apex of the spike and could account for the greater stability of theupright spikes on the late-passage, attenuated isolate. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruslive-attenuated vaccines generate broadly heterotypic protection, and B-cellsisolated from adults encode antibodies that are broadly protective in mice.Determining the structural and mechanistic basis of broad protection cancontribute to understanding the current limitations of vaccine efficacy indeveloping countries. The structure of an attenuated human rotavirus isolate(CDC-9) bound with the Fab fragment of a broadly heterotypic protective antibody shows that protection is probably due to inhibition of the conformationaltransition in the viral spike protein (VP4) critical for viral penetration,rather than to inhibition of receptor binding. A comparison of structures ofCDC-9 virus particles at two stages of serial passaging supports a proposedmechanism for initial steps in rotavirus membrane penetration.

TI  - Proteolytic Processing of the Coronavirus Replicase Nonstructural Protein 14Exonuclease Is Not Required for Virus Replication but Alters RNA Synthesis andViral Fitness.
PG  - e0084122
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00841-22 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) initiate replication by translation of the positive-senseRNA genome into the replicase polyproteins connecting 16 nonstructural proteindomains (nsp1-16), which are subsequently processed by viral proteases to yieldmature nsp. For the betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV), totalinhibition of translation or proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteinsresults in rapid cessation of RNA synthesis. The nsp5-3CLpro (Mpro) processesnsps7-16, which assemble into functional replication-transcription complexes(RTCs), including the enzymatic nsp12-RdRp and nsp14-exoribonuclease(ExoN)/N7-methyltransferase. The nsp14-ExoN activity mediates RNA-dependent RNAproofreading, high-fidelity RNA synthesis, and replication. To date, the solvedpartial RTC structures, biochemistry, and models use or assume completelyprocessed, mature nsp. Here, we demonstrate that in MHV, engineered deletion ofthe cleavage sites between nsp13-14 and nsp14-15 allowed recovery ofreplication-competent virus. Compared to wild-type (WT) MHV, the nsp13-14 andnsp14-15 cleavage deletion mutants demonstrated delayed replication kinetics,impaired genome production, altered abundance and patterns of recombination, and impaired competitive fitness. Further, the nsp13-14 and nsp14-15 mutant virusesdemonstrated mutation frequencies that were significantly higher than with theWT. The results demonstrate that cleavage of nsp13-14 or nsp14-15 is not requiredfor MHV viability and that functions of the RTC/nsp14-ExoN are impaired whenassembled with noncleaved intermediates. These data will inform future genetic,structural, biochemical, and modeling studies of coronavirus RTCs and nsp 13, 14,and 15 and may reveal new approaches for inhibition or attenuation of CoVinfection. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus replication requires proteolytic maturation of the nonstructural replicase proteins to form the replication-transcriptioncomplex. Coronavirus replication-transcription complex models assume maturesubunits; however, mechanisms of coronavirus maturation and replicase complexformation have yet to be defined. Here, we show that for the coronavirus murinehepatitis virus, cleavage between the nonstructural replicase proteins nsp13-14and nsp14-15 is not required for replication but does alter RNA synthesis andrecombination. These results shed new light on the requirements for coronavirusmaturation and replication-transcription complex assembly, and they may revealnovel therapeutic targets and strategies for attenuation.

TI  - A SCID Mouse Model To Evaluate the Efficacy of Antivirals against SARS-CoV-2Infection.
PG  - e0075822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00758-22 [doi]
AB  - Ancestral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lacks the intrinsic ability to bind to the mouse ACE2 receptor, and therefore establishmentof SARS-CoV-2 mouse models has been limited to the use of mouse-adapted virusesor genetically modified mice. Interestingly, some of the variants of concern,such as the Beta B.1.351 variant, show an improved binding to the mouse receptor and hence better replication in different wild-type (WT) mouse species. Here, we describe the establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 Beta B.1.351 variant infection modelin male SCID mice as a tool to assess the antiviral efficacy of potentialSARS-CoV-2 small-molecule inhibitors. Intranasal infection of male SCID mice with10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the Beta B.1.351 variantresulted in high viral loads in the lungs and moderate signs of lung pathology onday 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with the antiviral drugsmolnupiravir (200 mg/kg, twice a day [BID]) or nirmatrelvir (300 mg/kg, BID) for 3 consecutive days significantly reduced the infectious virus titers in the lungsby 2 and 3.9 log10 TCID50/mg of tissue, respectively, and significantly improved lung pathology. Together, these data demonstrate the validity of this SCID mouse Beta B.1.351 variant infection model as a convenient preclinical model forassessment of potential activity of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCEUnlike the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, the Beta (B.1.351) variant of concern hasbeen reported to replicate to some extent in WT mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Wedemonstrate here that infection of SCID mice with the Beta variant resulted inhigh viral loads in the lungs on day 3 postinfection. Treatment of infected mice with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir for 3 consecutive days markedly reduced theinfectious virus titers in the lungs and improved lung pathology. The SARS-CoV2SCID mouse infection model, which is ideally suited for antiviral studies, offersan advantage in comparison to other SARS-CoV2 mouse models, in that there is noneed for the use of mouse-adapted virus strains or genetically modified mice.Mouse models also have advantages over hamster models because (i) lower amountsof test drugs are needed, (ii) more animals can be housed in a cage, and (iii)reagents to analyze mouse samples are more readily available than those forhamsters.

TI  - Pandemic 1918 Influenza Virus Does Not Cause Lethal Infection in Rhesus orCynomolgus Macaques.
PG  - e0072822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00728-22 [doi]
AB  - The 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic was among the most severe in history, taking thelives of approximately 50 million people worldwide, and novel prophylacticvaccines are urgently needed to prevent another pandemic. Given that macaques arephysiologically relevant preclinical models of human immunology that haveadvanced the clinical treatment of infectious diseases, a lethal pandemicinfluenza challenge model would provide a stringent platform for testing newinfluenza vaccine concepts. To this end, we infected rhesus macaques andMauritian cynomolgus macaques with highly pathogenic 1918 H1N1 influenza virusand assessed pathogenesis and disease severity. Despite infection with a highdose of 1918 influenza delivered via multiple routes, rhesus macaquesdemonstrated minimal signs of disease, with only intermittent viral shedding.Cynomolgus macaques infected via intrabronchial instillation demonstrated mildsymptoms, with disease severity depending on the infection dose. Cynomolgusmacaques infected with a high dose of 1918 influenza delivered via multipleroutes experienced moderate disease characterized by consistent viral shedding,pulmonary infiltrates, and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. However, 1918influenza was uniformly nonlethal in these two species, demonstrating that thisisolate is insufficiently pathogenic in rhesus and Mauritian cynomolgus macaques to support testing novel prophylactic influenza approaches where protection from severe disease combined with a lethal outcome is desired as a highly stringentindication of vaccine efficacy. IMPORTANCE The world remains at risk of aninfluenza pandemic, and the development of new therapeutic and preventativemodalities is critically important for minimizing human death and sufferingduring the next influenza pandemic. Animal models are central to the development of new therapies and vaccine approaches. In particular, nonhuman primates likerhesus and cynomolgus macaques are highly relevant preclinical models given theirphysiological and immunological similarities to humans. Unfortunately, thereremains a scarcity of macaque models of pandemic influenza with which to testnovel antiviral modalities. Here, we demonstrate that even at the highest dosestested, 1918 influenza was not lethal in these two macaque species, suggestingthat they are not ideal for the development and testing of novel pandemicinfluenza-specific vaccines and therapies. Therefore, other physiologicallyrelevant nonhuman primate models of pandemic influenza are needed.

AB  - Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes using virally encodedRNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) with a common active-site structure andclosure mechanism upon which replication speed and fidelity can evolve tooptimize virus fitness. Coronaviruses (CoV) form large multicomponent RNAreplication-transcription complexes containing a core RNA synthesis machine made of the nsp12 RdRP protein with one nsp7 and two nsp8 proteins as essentialsubunits required for activity. We show that assembly of this complex can beaccelerated 5-fold by preincubation of nsp12 with nsp8 and further optimized withthe use of a novel nsp8L7 heterodimer fusion protein construct. Using rapidkinetics methods, we measure elongation rates of up to 260 nucleotides (nt)/s forthe core replicase, a rate that is unusually fast for a viral polymerase. Toaddress the origin of this fast rate, we examined the roles of two CoV-specificresidues in the RdRP active site: Ala547, which replaces a conserved glutamateabove the bound NTP, and Ser759, which mutates the palm domain GDD sequence toSDD. Our data show that Ala547 allows for a doubling of replication rate, butthis comes at a fidelity cost that is mitigated by using a SDD sequence in thepalm domain. Our biochemical data suggest that fixation of mutations inpolymerase motifs F and C played a key role in nidovirus evolution by tuningreplication rate and fidelity to accommodate their large genomes. IMPORTANCEReplicating large genomes represents a challenge for RNA viruses because fast RNAsynthesis is needed to escape innate immunity defenses, but faster polymerasesare inherently low-fidelity enzymes. Nonetheless, the coronaviruses replicatetheir approximately 30-kb genomes using the core polymerase structure andmechanism common to all positive-strand RNA viruses. The classic explanation for their success is that the large-genome nidoviruses have acquired anexonuclease-based repair system that compensates for the high polymerase mutationrate. In this work, we establish that the nidoviral polymerases themselves alsoplay a key role in maintaining genome integrity via mutations at two keyactive-site residues that enable very fast replication rates while maintainingtypical mutation rates. Our findings further demonstrate the evolutionaryplasticity of the core polymerase platform by showing how it has adapted duringthe expansion from short-genome picornaviruses to long-genome nidoviruses.

TI  - Structural Study of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Identifies a Broad-Spectrum AntibodyThat Neutralizes the Omicron Variant by Disassembling the Spike Trimer.
PG  - e0048022

AB  - The continuous emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) variants poses new challenges in the fight against the coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The newly emerging Omicron strain causedserious immune escape and raised unprecedented concern all over the world. Thedevelopment of an antibody targeting a conserved and universal epitope isurgently needed. A subset of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against COVID-19 fromconvalescent patients were isolated in our previous study. In this study, weinvestigated the accommodation of these NAbs to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern(VOCs), revealing that IgG 553-49 neutralizes pseudovirus of the SARS-CoV-2Omicron variant. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy(cryo-EM) structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein complexed with threemonoclonal antibodies targeting different epitopes, including 553-49, 553-15, and553-60. Notably, 553-49 targets a novel conserved epitope and neutralizes thevirus by disassembling S trimers. IgG 553-15, an antibody that neutralizes all ofthe VOCs except Omicron, cross-links two S trimers to form a trimer dimer,demonstrating that 553-15 neutralizes the virus by steric hindrance and virionaggregation. These findings suggest the potential to develop 553-49 and otherantibodies targeting this highly conserved epitope as promising therapeuticreagents for COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The emergence of the Omicron strain ofSARS-CoV-2 caused higher immune escape, raising unprecedented concerns about the effectiveness of antibody therapies and vaccines. In this study, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, 553-49, which neutralizes all variants bytargeting a completely conserved novel epitope. In addition, we revealed that IgG553-15 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by cross-linking virions and that 553-60 functions by blocking receptor binding. Comparison of different receptor binding domain(RBD) epitopes revealed that the 553-49 epitope is hidden in the S trimer andkeeps a high degree of conservation during SARS-CoV-2 evolution, making 553-49 a promising therapeutic reagent against the emerging Omicron and future variants ofSARS-CoV-2.

TI  - alpha2,3-Linked Sialic Acids Are the Potential Attachment Receptor for ShaanVirus Infection in MARC-145 Cells.
PG  - e0125622
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01256-22 [doi]
AB  - Shaan virus (ShaV), a novel species of the genus Jeilongvirus, familyParamyxoviridae, was isolated from an insectivore bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Korea in 2016. ShaV particles contain a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN)glycoprotein in their envelope that allows the virus to target cells. Typically, diverse paramyxoviruses with HN glycoprotein are reported to interactpredominantly with sialic acids, but there are no studies of receptors for ShaV. In this study, the identification of potential receptors for ShaV wasdemonstrated using sialidase treatments, glycan microarray, magnetic bead-basedvirus binding assay, and neuraminidase inhibitor treatments. Pretreatment ofMARC-145 cells with sialidase, which cleaves alpha2,3-linked sialic acids, showedhigher inhibition of viral infection than alpha2,6-linked-specific sialidase.These data were supported by the binding of ShaV to predominantly alpha2,3-linkedsialylated glycans in the screening of sialyl linkage patterns through glycanmicroarray. To further confirm the direct interaction between ShaV andalpha2,3-linked sialic acids, ShaV was incubated with alpha2,3- oralpha2,6-linked sialylated glycans conjugated to magnetic beads, and bindingsignals were detected only for alpha2,3-linked sialylated glycans. In addition,the potential of sialic acids as a receptor was demonstrated by the viralreplication inhibitory effect of the neuraminidase inhibitor2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminicacid (DANA) in the mature virion releasesteps. Collectively, these results support that alpha2,3-linked sialic acids are the potential receptor for ShaV infection in MARC-145 cells. IMPORTANCE Bats hostmajor mammalian paramyxoviruses, and novel paramyxoviruses are increasingly beingreported around the world. Shaan virus (ShaV), from the genus Jeilongvirus,family Paramyxoviridae, has a potential attachment glycoprotein, HN. Here, weidentify that ShaV binds to sialic acid and demonstrate that alpha2,3-linkedsialic acids are the potential receptor for ShaV infection. The presented dataregarding ShaV receptor specificity will enable studies into the viral tropismfor the host and contribute to the development of new antiviral strategiestargeting viral receptors.

TI  - The evolution of a counter-defense mechanism in a virus constrains its hostrange.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.79549 [doi]
LID - e79549 [pii]
AB  - Bacteria use diverse immunity mechanisms to defend themselves against their viralpredators, bacteriophages. In turn, phages can acquire counter-defense systems,but it remains unclear how such mechanisms arise and what factors constrain viralevolution. Here, we experimentally evolved T4 phage to overcome a phage-defensivetoxin-antitoxin system, toxIN, in E. coli. Through recombination, T4 rapidlyacquires segmental amplifications of a previously uncharacterized gene, now namedtifA, encoding an inhibitor of the toxin, ToxN. These amplifications subsequentlydrive large deletions elsewhere in T4's genome to maintain a genome sizecompatible with capsid packaging. The deleted regions include accessory genesthat help T4 overcome defense systems in alternative hosts. Thus, our resultsreveal a trade-off in viral evolution; the emergence of one counter-defensemechanism can lead to loss of other such mechanisms, thereby constraining hostrange. We propose that the accessory genomes of viruses reflect the integratedevolutionary history of the hosts they infected.

TI  - Genistein Targets STING-Driven Antiviral Responses.
PG  - e0206422
LID - 10.1128/mbio.02064-22 [doi]
AB  - Cytoplasmic detection of DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is anessential component of antiviral responses. Upon synthesis, cGAMP binds to thestimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING) in infected and adjacent cellsthrough intercellular transfer by connexins forming gap-junctions, eliciting astrong IFN-beta-driven antiviral response. We demonstrate here that Genistein, a flavonoid compound naturally occurring in soy-based foods, inhibits cGAS-STINGantiviral signaling at two levels. First, Genistein pretreatment ofcGAMP-producing cells inhibited gap-junction intercellular communication,resulting in reduced STING responses in adjacent cells. In addition, Genisteindirectly blocked STING activation by the murine agonist DMXAA, by decreasing the interaction of STING with TBK1 and IKKepsilon. As a result, Genistein attenuated STING signaling in human and mouse cells, dampening antiviral activity againstSemliki Forest Virus infection. Collectively, our findings identify a previously unrecognized proviral activity of Genistein mediated via its inhibitory effectsat two levels of cGAS-STING signaling. IMPORTANCE Several reports suggest thatGenistein exhibits antiviral activities against DNA viruses. Our work uncovers a previously unrecognized proviral effect of Genistein, through inhibition of thecGAS-STING pathway at the level of cGAMP transfer and its sensing by STING. This suggests that the use of Genistein as an antiviral should be taken with cautionas it may reduce the protective antiviral effects elicited by host STINGactivation.

TI  - Characterization of a Novel RNA Virus Causing Massive Mortality in YellowCatfish, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, as an Emerging Genus in Caliciviridae(Picornavirales).
PG  - e0062422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00624-22 [doi]
AB  - An emerging disease in farmed yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) causingmassive mortality broke out in 2020 in Hubei, China. Histopathologicalexamination indicated significant changes in kidneys and spleens of diseasedfish. Electron microscopy revealed large numbers of viral particles in thekidneys and spleens. These particles were spherical with a diameter ofapproximately 35 nm. By using RNA sequencing and rapid identification of cDNAends, the full nucleotide sequence of the virus was identified. The viral genome comprises 7,432 bp and contains three open reading frames sharing no nucleotidesequence similarity with other viruses; however, the amino acid sequencepartially matched that of the nonstructural (NS) proteins from viruses in theorder Picornavirales. Combined with the phylogenetic analysis, the conservedamino acid motifs and the domains of the viral genome predict a genome ordertypical of a calicivirus. Therefore, this virus was tentatively named yellowcatfish calicivirus (YcCV). Cell culture showed that YcCV could cause acytopathic effect in the channel catfish kidney cell line (CCK) at earlypassages. In artificial infection, this virus could infect healthy yellow catfishand led to clinical symptoms similar to those that occurred naturally. In situhybridization analysis detected positive signals of the virus in kidney, spleen, liver, heart, and gill tissues of diseased fish. This study represents the first report of calicivirus infection in yellow catfish and provides a solid basis for future studies on the control of this viral disease. IMPORTANCE Caliciviruses arerapidly evolving viruses that cause pandemic outbreaks associated withsignificant morbidity and mortality globally. A novel calicivirus identified fromyellow catfish also causes substantial mortality. Using an RNA sequencing(RNA-seq) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method, the full nucleotidesequence was identified and characterized, and this virus was tentatively namedyellow catfish calicivirus (YcCV). A nucleotide sequence similarity search found no match with other viruses, and an amino acid sequence comparison indicatedapproximately 23.3% amino acid homology with the viruses in the orderPicornavirales. These findings may represent a new avenue to explain virusevolution and suggest a need to further study the pathogenesis of calicivirus andcharacterize possible interactions among interspecific viruses in the aquacultureenvironment.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has become a global pandemic sinceDecember 2019. Most of the patients are mild or asymptomatic and recovered wellas those suffered from other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection issupposed to demonstrate more sequelae. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among COVID-19 patients and is associated with disease severity and outcomes. Only afew studies focused on a detailed analysis of kidney damage in asymptomatic ormildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Whether any minor viral infection is likelyto exhibit similar minor effect on renal function as COVID-19 is still unclear,and the definite pathophysiology of viral invasion is not fully understood.Currently, the proposed mechanisms of AKI include direct effects of virus onkidney, dysregulated immune response, or as a result of multi-organs failure havebeen proposed. This study will discuss the difference between COVID-19 and other viruses, focusing on proposed mechanisms, biomarkers and whether it matters with clinical significance.

TI  - Emerging immune-based technologies for high-grade gliomas.
LID - 10.1080/14737140.2022.2110072 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The selection of a tailored and successful strategy for high-grade gliomas (HGGs) treatment is still a concern. The abundance of aberrant mutations within the heterogenic genetic landscape of glioblastoma strongly influences cellexpansion, proliferation, and therapeutic resistance. Identification of immuneevasion pathways opens the way to novel immune-based strategies. This reviewintends to explore the emerging immunotherapies for HGGs. The immunosuppressivemechanisms related to the tumor microenvironment and future perspectives toovercome glioma immunity barriers are also debated. AREAS COVERED: An extensiveliterature review was performed on the PubMed/Medline and ClinicalTrials.govdatabases. Only highly relevant articles in English and published in the last 20 years were selected. Data about immunotherapies coming from preclinical andclinical trials were summarized. EXPERT OPINION: The overall level of evidenceabout the efficacy and safety of immunotherapies for HGGs is noteworthy.Monoclonal antibodies have been approved as second-line treatment, while peptide vaccines, viral gene strategies, and adoptive technologies proved to boost avivid antitumor immunization. Malignant brain tumor-treating fields areever-changing in the upcoming years. Constant refinements and development of new routes of drug administration will permit to design of novel immune-basedtreatment algorithms thus improving the overall survival.

TI  - Latent Tuberculosis among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Positive Patients:Prevalence and Correlates.
PG  - 670-677
LID - West Afr J Med. [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection affectingHIV-infected individuals and it remains the most common cause of death inpatients with AIDS. Detection of latent tuberculosis and treatment largelyprevents the development of active disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was todetermine the prevalence and factors associated with latent TB in HIV-positivepatients. METHODOLOGY: This is an analytical cross-sectional study which involved160 consented patients. Active tuberculosis was excluded using signs, symptomsand laboratory tests. All participants were tested using Quantiferon TB Gold Plustest kits. Data analysed with SPSS version 25.0 included patient's demographics, clinical and laboratory features. P< 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS:The mean age of HIV-infected patients was 42.69 +/- 9.91 years and the mean ageof the control was 41.29 +/- 9.20 years with no significant statisticaldifference. The prevalence of latent tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients wasfound to be 22.50% while among controls was 10.0% which was statisticallysignificant (p-0.001). CD4 cells count was observed to inversely predict latenttuberculosis (OR = 1.41; CI = 1.01-3.73) while viral load was found to directlypredict latent tuberculosis (OR = 1.63; CI=1.04-4.25). CONCLUSION: The prevalenceof latent tuberculosis infection is significantly higher among HIV-positivepatients when compared with HIV-negative patients. Also, the prevalence of HIVinfection was higher amongst the female and less educated population.

PG  - 668-673
LID - 10.6002/ect.2022.0079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure remains alife-threatening syndrome, and transplant is the definitive treatment. Earlyallograft dysfunction is a postoperative complication and affects morbidity andmortality. We studied the risk factors associated with early allograftdysfunction in livertransplantrecipients with hepatitis B virus-relatedacute-on-chronic liver failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-centerretrospective study of early allograft dysfunction is based on data from January 2015 to June 2020 for 323 recipients with hepatitis B virus-relatedacute-on-chronic liver failure and 445 with only hepatitis B virus infection(control group). Data that correlated with early allograft dysfunction andoutcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Incidence of early allograft dysfunction inpatients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure wassignificantly higher versus the control group (39.3% vs 21.1%; P < .001).Transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-onchronic liverfailure who developed early allograft dysfunction had lower 90-day, 180-day, and 360-day patient survival rates versus patients with no early allograftdysfunction (89.0% vs 98.0%, 82.7% vs 97.5%, and 80.3% vs 96.4%, respectively; P < .001). Pretransplant kidney failure (odds ratio, 2.644; 95% CI, 1.019-6.864; P = .046), pretransplant coagulation failure (odds ratio, 2.162; 95% CI,1.291-3.621; P = .003), and operative time (odds ratio, 1.005; 95% CI,1.002-1.008; P = .003) were independent risk factors for early allograftdysfunction in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-relatedacute-onchronic liver failure. There was a synergistic effect of early allograft dysfunction and preoperative kidney/coagulation failure on survival rates ofliver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liverfailure. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative kidney/coagulation failure and operative time were independent risk factors of early allograft dysfunction in deceased donorliver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liverfailure. The combination of early allograft dysfunction and preoperativekidney/coagulation failure was significantly associated with lower survival ofthese recipients.

LID - 10.6002/ect.2021.0363 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) are widely used in kidney transplant to prevent acute transplantrejection; however,the effects ofthese medications on graft sequelae after transplant remain unclear. We aimed to compare early complications, including graftrejectionandinfectionrates afterkidney transplant, in childrenbetween the cyclosporine and tacrolimusimmunomodulator regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohortstudy, 105 pediatric patients who were candidates to receive kidney transplant inthe age range of 4 to 18 years were included. There were 28 patients who receivedcyclosporine, and 77 patients who received tacrolimus. Participants wereroutinely tested for cytomegalovirus, BK virus, and bacterial infection on amonthly basis for the first 3 months and once every 3 months thereafter for thefirst year. The graft rejection rate was also assessed and compared between the 2treatment regimens. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus in graft rejection rate (P = .719),cytomegalovirus viremia (P = .112), BK viremia (P = .278), and bacterialinfection (P = .897). Graftfailure was significantly more frequent in male thanin female patients (30.9% vs 8.2%; P = .004). The rates of graft failure in studypatients with and without previous history of graftfailure were found to bestatistically similar (16.7% vs 20.4%; P = .825). History of infection in donors did not affect the graft complications posttransplant in recipients. CONCLUSIONS:The use of either tacrolimus or cyclosporine leads to similar consequences interms of graft rejection or posttransplant viral and bacterial infection, soeither drug may be exchanged for the other if needed for tolerability.

AB  - Monkeypox 2022 exhibits unprecedented human-to-human transmission and presentswith different clinical features than those observed in prior outbreaks.Previously endemic only to West and Central Africa, the monkeypox virus spreadrapidly world-wide following confirmation of a case in the United Kingdom on May 7, 2022 of an individual that had traveled to Nigeria. Detection of cases with notravel history confirms on-going community spread. Emergency Medical Services(EMS) professionals will likely encounter patients suspected or confirmed to havemonkeypox, previously a rare disease and therefore unfamiliar to most clinicians.Consequently, it is critical for EMS medical directors to immediately implementpolicies and procedures for EMS teams - including emergency medical dispatchers -to identify potential monkeypox cases. These must include direction on actionsEMS professionals should take to protect themselves and others from virustransmission. Monkeypox 2022 may manifest more subtly than it has historically.Presentations include a subclinical prodrome and less dramatic skin lesions -potentially limited to genital or anal body regions - which can be easilyconfused with dermatologic manifestations of common sexually transmittedinfections (STIs). While most readily spread by close contact with infectiousskin lesions on a patient, it is also transmissible from fomites, such as bedsheets. Additionally, droplet transmission can occur, and the virus can be spreadby aerosolization under certain conditions. The long incubation period could haveprofound negative consequences on EMS staffing if clinicians are exposed tomonkeypox. This report summarizes crucial information needed for EMSprofessionals to understand and manage the monkeypox 2022 outbreak. It presentsan innovative Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool for use by EMS policymakers,educators, and clinicians on the frontlines who may encounter monkeypox patients.Patients are identified as potentially exposed or infected after an initialassessment of risk factors with associated signs and symptoms. Prehospitalworkers must immediately don personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolateinfectious patients. Also, EMS professionals must report exposures to theiragency infection control officer and alert health authorities for non-transportedpatients. Prehospital professionals play a crucial role in emerging andre-emerging infectious disease mitigation. The monkeypox 2022 3I Tool includesknowledge essential for all clinicians, plus specific information to guidecritical actions in the prehospital environment.

TI  - Mannose Binding Lectin-Associated Serine Protease 2 (MASP2) Gene Polymorphism andsusceptibility to Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Infection in BloodDonors of Mashhad, Iran.
LID - 10.1111/1348-0421.13022 [doi]
AB  - Mannose binding lectin-associated serine protease 2 (MASP2) is the effector part of mannose binding lectin (MBL) that activates the complement system in anantibody-independent manner. We aimed to investigate the role of geneticpolymorphisms in the MASP2 gene and susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection. A totalof 172 HTLV-1 infected individuals and 170 healthy blood donors were analyzed in this case-control study. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encompassingdifferent regions of the MASP2 gene were genotyped with a PCR-SSP assay. Therelation between SNPs genotype and susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection wasinvestigated with a chi-squared test considering p<0.05 as statisticallysignificant. Two out of nine tested SNPs were associated with the risk of HTLV-1 infection. The genotype TT at rs17409276 decreased the risk of HTLV-1 (p=0.005,OR=0.301, 95% CI=0.124-0.728). The genotypes CC and CT at rs2273346 were alsoassociated with a higher risk of HTLV-1 acquisition (p=0.004, OR=2.225, 95%CI=1.277-3.877). These findings highlight the importance of MASP2 geneticpolymorphisms in the lectin pathway of complement activation and susceptibilityto HTLV-1 infection. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future pandemics.
LID - 10.1080/14760584.2022.2110075 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vaccination continues to be the most effective method forcontrolling COVID-19 infectious diseases. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 variantscontinue to evolve and emerge, resulting in significant public concerns worldwideeven after more than two years since the COVID-19 pandemic. It is significant to better understand how different COVID-19 vaccine platforms work, why SARS-CoV-2variants continue to emerge, and what options for improving COVID-19 vaccines canbe considered to fight against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future pandemics. AREACOVERED: Here, we reviewed the innate immune sensors in the recognition ofSARS-CoV-2 virus, innate and adaptive immunity including neutralizing antibodies by different COVID-19 vaccines. Efficacy comparison of the several COVID-19vaccine platforms approved to use in humans, concerns about SARS-CoV-2 variantsand breakthrough infections, and the options for developing future COIVD-19vaccines were also covered. EXPERT OPINION: Owing to the continuous emergence of novel pathogens and the re-emergence of variants, safer and more effective newvaccines are needed. This review is also aimed to provide the knowledge basis forthe development of next-generation COVID-19 and pan-coronavirus vaccines toprovide cross-protection against new SARS-CoV-2 variants and future coronaviruspandemics.

LID - 10.4155/tde-2021-0091 [doi]
AB  - Protein nanomaterials are well-defined, hollow protein nanoparticles comprised ofvirus capsids, virus-like particles, ferritin, heat shock proteins, chaperoninsand many more. Protein-based nanomaterials are formed by the self-assembly ofprotein subunits and have numerous desired properties as drug-delivery vehicles, including being optimally sized for endocytosis, nontoxic, biocompatible,biodegradable and functionalized at three separate interfaces (external, internaland intersubunit). As a result, protein nanomaterials have been intensivelyinvestigated as functional entities in bionanotechnology, including drugdelivery, nanoreactors and templates for organic and inorganic nanomaterials.Several variables influence efficient administration, particularly activetargeting, cellular uptake, the kinetics of the release and systemic elimination.This review examines the wide range of medicines, loading/release processes,targeted therapies and treatment effectiveness.

LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20210223-00273 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive role of dynamic changes of plasmabiomarkers in patients with viral and mycoplasma community-acquired pneumonia(CAP). METHODS: From January 2020 to June 2020, 141 patients with viral andmycoplasma CAP in People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region wereenrolled. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores [grade I-II (PSI score </= 70),grade III (PSI score 71-90) and grade IV-V (PSI score >/= 91)], serum amyloid A(SAA), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), procalcitonin (PCT),erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and white blood cell (WBC) on the 1 dayafter admission were compared between the different pathogens (viral andmycoplasma) or different disease severity. The change in level of SAA, hs-CRP on the third day (Delta3 d = 1 d-3 d) were compared among different disease outcome groups (patients were divided into improved group, stable group and exacerbation group based on PSI scores or lung CT images on the third day). The change in the level of SAA, hs-CRP on the seventh day (Delta7 d = 1 d-7 d) were compared among different disease prognosis groups (patients were divided into survival group anddeath group based on 28-day survival data). The receiver operating characteristiccurve (ROC) were drawn to evaluate the value of SAA in the evaluation of disease and prediction prognosis. RESULTS: The level of SAA in mycoplasma group (43cases) was significantly higher than that in virus group (98 cases) on the 1 day after admission. There were no significant differences in other plasma biomarkersbetween the two groups. The more severe the illness, the higher the SAA level on the 1 day after admission. The trends of other plasma biomarkers in the twogroups were consistent with SAA. The levels of SAA in the patients withexacerbation of the virus group and mycoplasma group (12 cases, 9 cases) weresignificantly higher than those of the improved group (57 cases, 26 cases) andthe stable group (29 cases, 8 cases). SAA increased gradually in the exacerbationgroup, decreased gradually in the improved group, and slightly increased in thestable group. DeltaSAA3 d were differences among three groups. The change trendof hs-CPR was consistent with SAA. The level of SAA in the death group was higherthan that in the survival group on the seventh day. SAA increased in the deathgroup and decreased in survival group with time from hospital admission. Therewere differences according to DeltaSAA7 d between death group and survival group.The change trend of hs-CPR was consistent with SAA. ROC curve showed that thevalue of SAA was better than hs-CRP in assessing the severity of patients onadmission day, and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was respectively 0.777 [95%confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.669-0.886], 0.729 (95%CI was 0.628-0.830). The value of DeltaSAA3 d was better than SAA on the third day predicting diseasetrends, and AUC was respectively 0.979 (95%CI was 0.921-1.000), 0.850 (95%CI was 0.660-1.000). hs-CRP on the third day and Deltahs-CRP3 d had no predictive value.Both SAA on the seventh day and DeltaSAA7 d have predictive value for prognosis. AUC was respectively 0.954 (95%CI was 0.898-0.993) and 0.890 (95%CI was0.689-1.000). SAA on the seventh day and DeltaSAA7 d were better than hs-CRP onthe seventh day. Deltahs-CRP7 d have no predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: SAA is asensitive and valuable indicator for CAP patients with viruses and mycoplasma.Dynamic monitoring of SAA can evaluate the patient's progression, prognosis, and assist diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influencing factors of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (ETI-MV) in patients with acute respiratory distresssyndrome (ARDS) caused by viral pneumonia, and to provide evidence forindividualized use of ETI-MV. METHODS: Patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of the First AffiliatedHospital of Xinjiang Medical University were retrospectively analyzed fromNovember 2017 to March 2022. The gender, age, concomitant diseases, clinicalsymptoms and signs, complications, lab results, ARDS severity, infectious virustype, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), respiratory support methods and prognosis-related variables were collected. Univariateanalysis was performed on each factor, and the variables with statisticalsignificance in the univariate analysis were subjected multivariate logisticregression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of each index for the implementation ofETI-MV. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were enrolled in the study, including 61patients in the ETI-MV group, and 3 patients (4.9%), 39 patients (63.9%) and 19patients (31.1%) with mild, moderate and severe ARDS, respectively. There were 56patients in non-ETI-MV group, and the mild, moderate and severe ARDS cases were16 cases (28.6%), 38 cases (67.8%) and 2 cases (3.6%), respectively. There wassignificant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). Univariate analysisshowed that during 24 hours admitted to RICU, the levels of interleukin-6 [IL-6(ng/L): 104.0+/-90.0 vs. 62.4+/-76.0], oxygenation index [PaO2/FiO2 (mmHg, 1 mmHgapproximately 0.133 kPa): 123.9+/-30.9 vs. 173.6+/-28.5], the proportion of caseswith pulmonary infiltrating opacity distribution range >/= 3/4 lung fields [85.3%(52/61) vs. 21.5% (12/56)], APACHE II score >/= 16.5 [67.2% (41/61) vs. 42.9%(24/56)], the rate of nosocomial invasive aspergillus infection [14.8% (9/61) vs.3.6% (2/56)], the percentage of nosocomial bacterial infection [16.4% (10/61) vs.3.6% (2/56)], and the lowest CD4(+) T lymphocyte count in the course of thedisease [cells/mm(3): 192.2+/-35.8 vs. 215.0+/-58.3] had significant differences between ETI-MV and non-ETI-MV group (all P < 0.05). Multivariate Logisticregression analysis showed that during 24 hours admitted to RICU the distributionrange of pulmonary infiltrating opacity >/= 3/4 the lung fields [odds ratio (OR) = 12.527, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 3.279-47.859, P < 0.001], APACHE IIscore >/= 16.5 (OR = 30.604, 95%CI = 4.318-216.932, P = 0.001), PaO2/FiO2 (OR =0.948, 95%CI = 0.925-0.972, P < 0.001), CD4(+) T lymphocytes cell count (OR =0.975, 95%CI = 0.955-0.995, P = 0.015), and nosocomial bacterial infection (OR = 38.338, 95%CI = 1.638-897.158, P = 0.023) were independent risk factors forETI-MV. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of ROC showed that PaO2/FiO2 had thegreatest predictive value for ETI-MV, with AUC of 0.903, sensitivity of 91.1% andspecificity of 95.1% in case of cutoff value of 151 mmHg. The AUC of pulmonaryinfiltrating opacity distribution range was 0.809, the sensitivity of 85.2%,specificity of 78.6% when the cutoff value was >/= 3/4 lung field. APACHE IIscores had the lowest predictive value for selecting ETI-MV, with AUC of 0.704,sensitivity of 83.6% and specificity of 57.1% under the cutoff value was 16.5.CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ARDS caused by viral pneumonia, PaO2/FiO2 is stillthe classic reference for selecting ETI-MV, however, the distribution range ofpulmonary infiltrating opacity and the systemic severity of the disease during 24hours admitted to the RICU may provide supplemental helpful information todetermine whether the patients choose ETI-MV, especially for moderate ARDS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the changes of clinical characteristics and immune-related indicators of patients with mild and moderate acute Omicron variant infection,and to evaluate the protective effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)vaccination. METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the clinicalcharacteristics of 317 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 Omicron variant(B1.1.529) infection admitted to Tianjin First Central Hospital (Shuixi District)from January 22, 2022 to February 24, 2022. Demographic characteristics,vaccination status, underlying diseases, epidemiological characteristics,baseline data, and relevant laboratory test results on admission were collected, and the differences in clinical characteristics, especially the changes inimmune-related indicators, between mild and moderate patients were compared andanalyzed. RESULTS: Among the 317 adult patients with acute Omicron variantinfection, the proportion of elderly, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases were significantly higher in moderate group (203cases) than those of mild group (114 cases) [age >/= 60 years old: 27.58%(56/203) vs. 9.65% (11/114), hypertension: 31.03% (63/203) vs. 19.30% (22/114),diabetes: 15.76% (32/203) vs. 7.89% (9/114), cardiovascular and cerebrovasculardiseases: 11.33% (23/203) vs 0.88% (1/114), all P < 0.05]. The route oftransmission was mainly through gatherings and the first symptoms were fever, drycough, fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose and other flu symptoms;19.30% (22/114) and 24.63% (50/203) of patients in mild and moderate groups were positive for the new coronavirus nucleic acid test, respectively, but thedifference was not significant difference (P > 0.05). Inflammatory indicators in most mild and moderate patients were within normal range, such as white bloodcell count (WBC), neutrophil ratio (NEU%), lymphocyte count (LYM), C-reactiveprotein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), etc., suggestingthat the acute phase of Omicron variant infection had not yet caused severeinflammatory storm, which might be related to the weakening of pathogenicityafter vaccination and virus mutation. The proportion of patients with IL-6 > 7ng/L in the mild group was significantly lower than that in the normal group[1.75% (2/114) vs. 6.40% (13/203), P < 0.05], suggesting that elevated IL-6 mightbe an important factor in evaluating indicators of disease severity. There was nosignificant difference in lymphocyte subsets between the two groups, but therewere 12.90% (12/93) and 11.04% (17/154) of the patients in two groups,respectively, decreased in the proportion of helper T cells, and 18.28% (17/93)and 14.28% (22/154) of the patients had elevated CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, suggesting that patients with Omicron variant infection had autoimmune system dysfunction,which might be related to disease progression and the occurrence of long-termautoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-6 level may be used as a predictor for evaluating the severity of disease in patients with Omicron variant infection;after vaccination, inflammatory indicators in patients with acute Omicron variantinfection were significantly reduced, but the long-term effects still requirelong-term follow-up observation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of awake prone positioning (APP) forcommon coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Omicron variant. METHODS:Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 caused byOmicron variant admitted by medical team of Tianjin Third Central Hospital duringthe period of supporting Tianjin COVID-19 designated hospital from January 8 toFebruary 20, 2022. Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for common COVID-19and had risk factors for developing severe disease or had pulse oxygen saturation(SpO2) </= 0.93 after exercise without supplementary oxygen were enrolled.Patients were divided into APP group and control group according to whether they completed the daily 12-hours APP in the first three days after enrollment.Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, COVID-19 vaccination status,laboratory examination, disease progression (progression to severe), time tonucleic acid negative conversion, length of hospital stay, and adverse reactions and tolerability [visual analog scale (VAS) score (the higher the score, theworse the tolerability] during APP were evaluated in two groups. Interleukin-6(IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), SpO2/inhaled oxygen concentration (FiO2) ratio and ROX index (ROXI) were compared between two groups at enrollment, 3rd and 7th day after enrollment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences indemographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, vaccination rates of COVID-19 andlaboratory tests between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between two groups at the timeof enrollment. Compared with the group at the time of enrollment, SpO2/FiO2 ratioand ROXI in APP group increased significantly at the 3rd day after enrollment[SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90 (457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (437.14, 457.10), ROXI:25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs. 22.57 (21.86, 24.40), all P < 0.05], and the levels ofIL-6 and CRP in control group were significantly increased [IL-6 (ng/L): 18.30(6.50, 37.75) vs. 7.40 (5.10, 11.15), CRP (mg/L): 11.46 (2.11, 17.96) vs. 4.11(1.72, 9.05), all P < 0.05]. At the 3rd day of enrollment, the levels of IL-6 andCRP in APP group were significantly lower than those in control group [IL-6(ng/L): 7.35 (4.35, 12.80) vs. 18.30 (6.50, 37.75), CRP (mg/L): 4.52 (1.98, 9.66)vs. 11.46 (2.11, 17.96), all P < 0.05], while SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI weresignificantly higher than those in control group [SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 461.90(457.10, 466.70) vs. 446.67 (441.90, 459.52), ROXI: 25.40 (23.33, 25.93) vs.23.31 (22.10, 24.66), all P < 0.05]. At the 7th day of enrollment,there were nosignificant differences in IL-6, CRP, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and ROXI between twogroups. There were no severe cases in both groups. The time of nucleic acidnegative conversion and length of hospital stay in APP group were significantlyshorter than those in control group [10.0 (8.0, 12.0) days vs. 11.0 (9.0, 13.0)days, 12.0 (10.0, 14.0) days vs. 14.0 (12.0,16.0) days, respectively, all P <0.05]. The main adverse reaction during APP was back pain, and the incidence inAPP group was slightly lower than that in control group, but the difference wasnot statistically significant [17.9% (17/95) vs. 26.5% (27/102), P = 0.149]. VAS score in control group was significantly higher than that in APP group [score:2.5 (2.0, 4.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS: In common COVID-19patients caused by Omicron variant with high risk factors for progression tosevere disease or decreased oxygen reserve capacity, early APP can shorten thetime of nucleic acid negative conversion and the length of hospital stay, but itseffect on preventing disease progression cannot be determined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients inoculated withdifferent vaccines and underlying diseases, infected with the novel coronavirusOmicron variant. METHODS: The data of 430 patients infected with the novelcoronavirus Omicron variant who were admitted to Tianjin First Center Hospitalfrom January 21, 2022 to March 7, 2022 were collected. A total of 108 patientswith Omicron variant infection with underlying diseases were selected andenrolled. The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), history of underlying diseases,vaccination status (vaccination times, vaccination type), clinical symptoms,laboratory test indicators, imaging data, hospitalization time, nucleic acidnegative conversion time, re-positivity and antibody titer from the two groups ofthe patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In the 108 patients, 93 cases received inactivated vaccine and 15 cases received adenovirus vaccine. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms ofgender, age, BMI, disease types, whether completed the fully vaccinated, whether had prime boost and underlying diseases. Both groups had fever, dry cough, sorethroat, runny nose and other clinical symptoms, but there were no statisticaldifference between the two groups. There were no statistically significantdifferences in laboratory blood routine tests, biochemical indexes, C-reactiveprotein (CRP) level and the results of chest computed tomography (CT) imagingbetween the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences inhospitalization days, nucleic acid negative conversion time, whether admission tointensive care unit (ICU), turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests andimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titer expression between the two groups, butimmunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer in adenovirus group was higher than that ininactivated group (g/L: 229.67+/-26.13 vs. 194.33+/-61.56, P = 0.020). There werealso no significant differences in laboratory examinations, hospitalization days,nucleic acid negative conversion time, turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests andNovel coronavirus antibody titers expression of the patients with booster shotsbetween the inactivated vaccine group and the adenovirus vaccine group.CONCLUSIONS: The protection of inactivated virus vaccine is equivalent toadenovirus vaccine in patients with underlying disease Omicron variant infection,and the titer of IgG antibody in patients with adenovirus vaccine is higher than that in patients with inactivated virus vaccine after one week of recovery.

AB  - Monkeypox (MPX), is a rare endemic zoonotic disease of certain areas of Centraland West Africa. Nevertheless, in recent years, several outbreaks have occurredoutside the African continent. Monkeypox usually presents with a flu-likeprodromal period (fever, headache, chills, sweating) associated or followed bythe appearance of lymphadenopathy and a typical skin rash. Transmission issuspected to be direct or indirect via contact with saliva, respiratory droplets or skin lesions of infected animals or more rarely of humans. The gold standardfor diagnosis is the detection of MPX virus (MPXV) by PCR on skin lesion fluid.The evolution is usually favourable in 2 to 5 weeks but severe complications and sequelae are possible. In the absence of a specific treatment, the management is essentially supportive: appropriate local care, rehydration, analgesia andmanagement of eventual complications.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes congenital defects. Sexual transmission of ZIKV was confirmed in a recent epidemic; however,mechanisms behind ZIKV infection and persistence in the male reproductive tractare unknown. Previously, we found that approximately 33% of men with symptomatic ZIKV infections shed ZIKV RNA in semen, and some men shed ZIKV RNA for >3 months.Here, we evaluated the semen of 49 ZIKV-infected men to identify immune factorscorrelating with long-term ZIKV shedding in semen and ZIKV-infected cell types insemen. We found prolonged ZIKV RNA shedding in semen was associated with malereproductive tract inflammation, indicated by higher leukocyte counts andinflammatory cytokine concentrations in semen of long-term versus short-termshedders. Additionally, we found ZIKV RNA in seminal leukocytes and epithelialcells. This study of human semen from ZIKV-infected men provides criticalinsights into impacts of ZIKV on male reproductive tract health.

TI  - Geriatric risk and protective factors for serious COVID-19 outcomes among olderadults in Shanghai Omicron wave.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2022.2109517 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omicron variant was featured with high transmissibility and striking antibody evasion. Shanghai has been experiencing Omicron wave since March 2022.Though several studies have evaluated the risk factors of severe infections, the analyses of BA.2 infection risk and protective factors among geriatric people wasmuch limited. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study described clinicalcharacteristics of geriatric Omicron infections (aged more than 60), and assessedrisk and protective factors for severe infections. RESULTS: A total of 1377patients older than 60 were enrolled, with 75.96% had comorbidities. The medianviral shedding time and hospitalization time was 9 and 8 days, respectively.Severe/critical were associated with longer virus clearance time (aOR[95%CI]:0.706(0.533-0.935), P=0.015)), while fully vaccinated/booster andpaxlovid use shortened viral shedding time (1.229 [1.076-1.402], P=0.002; 1.140[.019-1.274], P=0.022, respectively). Older age (>80), cerebrovascular disease,and chronic kidney disease were risk factors of progressing to severe/critical.Fully vaccination was a significant protective factor of severe infections(0.237[0.071-0.793], P=0.019). Further, we found patients with more than twocomorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome in all age groups.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that in the elderly older than 60 yearsold, older age (aged over 80), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidneydisease were risk factors of severe infection. Patients with more than twocomorbidities were more likely to get serious outcome. Fully vaccinated/boosterpatients were less likely to be severe and vaccinations could shorten viralshedding time. The limitation of lacking overall spectrum of COVID-19 infections among elders could be compensated in other larger scale studies in the future.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2-Specific Adaptive Immunity in COVID-19 Survivors With Asthma.
PG  - 947724
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.947724 [doi]
AB  - Background: Asthma patients potentially have impaired adaptive immunity to virus infection. The levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity between COVID-19survivors with and without asthma are presently unclear. Methods: COVID-19survivors (patients with asthma n=11, with allergies n=8, and COVID-19 only n=17)and non-COVID-19 individuals (asthmatic patients n=10 and healthy controls n=9)were included. The COVID-19 patients were followed up at about 8 months and 16months after discharge. The clinical characteristics, lymphocyte subsets, memory T cells, and humoral immunity including SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies,SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, and memory B cells wereanalyzed in these subjects. Results: The strength of virus-specific T cellresponse in COVID-19 survivors was positively correlated with the percentage ofblood eosinophils and Treg cells (r=0.4007, p=0.0188; and r=0.4435, p=0.0086respectively) at 8-month follow-up. There were no statistical differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response between the COVID-19 survivorswith, and without, asthma. Compared to those without asthma, the COVID-19 withasthma survivors had higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies(NAbs) at the 8-month follow-up (p<0.05). Moreover, the level of NAbs in COVID-19survivors was positively correlated with the percentage of Treg and cTfh2 cells(r=0.5037, p=0.002; and r=0.4846, p=0.0141), and negatively correlated with thepercentage of Th1 and Th17 cells (r=-0.5701, p=0.0003; and r=-0.3656, p=0.0308), the ratio of Th1/Th2, Th17/Treg, and cTfh1/cTfh2 cell (r=-0.5356, r=-0.5947,r=-0.4485; all p<0.05). The decay rate of NAbs in the COVID-19 survivors withasthma was not significantly different from that of those without asthma at16-month follow-up. Conclusion: The level of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs in COVID-19survivors with asthma was higher than that of those without asthma at 8-monthfollow-up. The SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity was associated with bloodeosinophils and Treg percentages. The SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity wasclosely associated with cTfh2/cTfh1 imbalance and Treg/Th17 ratio. According tothe findings, asthmatic patients in COVID-19 convalescent period may benefit froman enhanced specific humoral immunity, which associates with skewed Th2/Th1 andTreg/Th17 immune.

AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro antiviral activities and the ex vivoimmunomodulatory effects of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (HC) ethanolic extracts in response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Inaddition, this study evaluated the in vivo effects of oral supplementation of HC extract on immune responses to and cross-protective efficacy of PRRSV-1modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine against the highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV-2challenge. In vitro experiments demonstrated that HC extracted in either 50%,70%, or 95% ethanol (referred to as HC50, HC70, and HC95, respectively)significantly interfered with PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Ex vivoexperiments revealed that all HC extracts significantly enhanced mRNA expressionsof type I interferon-regulated genes, type I and II interferon (IFN), and pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in HP-PRRSV-2-inoculated monocyte-derivedmacrophages. An in vivo experiment included four groups of six pigs (4 weeks old;n = 24). Group 1 and group 2 were vaccinated with the PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine at 0dpv (day post vaccination). Group 2 also received oral administration of HC50extract at 0-49 dpv. Group 3 received the PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine solvent at 0 dpv,while group 4 served as strict control. Groups 1-3 were challenged intranasallywith HP-PRRSV-2 at 28 dpv and immune-related and clinical parameters weremonitored weekly until 49 dpv. Compared to group 1, group 2 demonstratedsignificantly increased IFN regulatory factor 3 mRNA expression of PRRSV-recalledperipheral blood mononuclear cells, and significantly reduced HP-PRRSV-2 viremia.No difference in PRRSV-specific antibody responses, rectal temperature, clinical scores, and average daily weight gain was detected. Our study reports theimmunomodulatory and anti-PRRSV potentials of HC extract in PRRSV-1MLV-vaccinated/HP-PRRSV-2 challenged pigs.

AB  - Introduction: Current human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines consist of virus-likeparticles (VLPs) which are based on the L1 protein, but they are produced bydifferent expression systems and use different adjuvants. We performed in-depthimmunophenotyping of multiple innate and adaptive immune cells after vaccination with bivalent versus nonavalent HPV vaccines. Method: Twenty pre-menopausalHPV-seronegative women were enrolled and randomized to receive three-doses ofeither the bivalent or the nonavalent HPV vaccine. Blood samples were collectedat multiple time points from baseline up to 7 months after first vaccination.Four extensive EuroFlow flow cytometry antibody panels were used to monitorvarious immune cell subsets. Additionally, HPV-specific memory B- and T cellswere determined by ELISPOT and HPV-specific antibody levels were measured by aVLP-based multiplex immunoassay. Results: In both cohorts, the numbers of plasma cells expanded in the first week after both primary and tertiary vaccination.HPV16 and HPV18-specific antibody levels and memory B and T-cell responses werehigher in the bivalent than in the nonavalent vaccinees one month post thirdvaccination. For HPV31 and HPV45-specific antibody levels this pattern wasreversed. Monocytes showed an expansion one day after vaccination in both cohortsbut were significantly higher in the bivalent vaccine cohort. Large heterogeneityin responses of the other cell subsets was observed between donors. Conclusion:This pilot study showed a consistent response of monocytes and plasma cells aftervaccination and a considerable variation in other circulating immune cells inboth types of HPV vaccines between donors.

AB  - Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), a heterogenous group of inborn errors ofimmunity, are predetermined at birth but may evolve with age, leading to avariable clinical and laboratory presentation. In contrast, secondaryimmunodeficiencies (SIDs) are acquired declines of immune cell counts andor/function. The most common type of SID is a decreased antibody level occurring as a consequence of extrinsic influences, such as an underlying condition or aside effect of some medications used to treat hematological malignancies andautoimmune disorders. Paradoxically, immune deficiencies initially attributed to secondary causes may partly be due to an underlying PID. Therefore, in the era ofimmune-modulating biologicals, distinguishing between primary and secondaryantibody deficiencies is of great importance. It can be difficult to unravel the relationship between PID, SID and hematological malignancy or autoimmunity in theclinical setting. This review explores SID and PID crossovers and discusseschallenges to diagnosis and treatment strategies. The case of an immunodeficient patient with follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab illustrates how SID inthe setting of hematological cancer can mask an underlying PID, and highlightsthe importance of screening such patients. The risk of hematological cancer isincreased in PID: for example, lymphomas in PID may be driven by infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, and germline mutations associated with PID are enrichedamong patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Clues suggesting an increased risk of hematological malignancy in patients with common variable immunedeficiency (CVID) are provided, as well as pointers for distinguishing PID versusSID in lymphoma patients. Two cases of patients with autoimmune disordersillustrate how an apparent rituximab-induced antibody deficiency can be connectedto an underlying PID. We highlight that PID is increasingly recognized amongpatients with autoimmune cytopenias, and provide guidance on how to identify PID and distinguish it from SID in such patients. Overall, healthcare professionalsencountering patients with malignancy and/or autoimmunity who have post-treatmentcomplications of antibody deficiencies or other immune abnormalities need to beaware of the possibility of PID or SID and how to differentiate them.

PG  - 894872
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.894872 [doi]
AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune neurological disorder oftenpreceded by viral illnesses or, more rarely, vaccinations. We report on a unique combination of postcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine GBS that occurred months after a parainfectious COVID-19-related GBS. Shortly after manifestingCOVID-19 symptoms, a 57-year-old man developed diplopia, right-side facialweakness, and gait instability that, together with electrophysiology andcerebrospinal fluid examinations, led to a diagnosis of post-COVID-19 GBS. Theinvolvement of cranial nerves and IgM seropositivity for ganglioside GD1b werenoteworthy. COVID-19 pneumonia, flaccid tetraparesis, and autonomic dysfunctionprompted his admission to ICU. He recovered after therapy with intravenousimmunoglobulins (IVIg). Six months later, GBS recurred shortly after the firstdose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Again, the GBS diagnosis was confirmed bycerebrospinal fluid and electrophysiology studies. IgM seropositivity extended tomultiple gangliosides, namely for GM3/4, GD1a/b, and GT1b IgM. An IVIg courseprompted complete recovery. This case adds to other previously reportedobservations suggesting a possible causal link between SARS-CoV-2 and GBS.Molecular mimicry and anti-idiotype antibodies might be the underlyingmechanisms. Future COVID-19 vaccinations/revaccinations in patients with previouspara-/post-COVID-19 GBS deserve a reappraisal, especially if they areseropositive for ganglioside antibodies.

TI  - Are Face Masks a Problem for Emotion Recognition? Not When the Whole Body IsVisible.
PG  - 915927
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2022.915927 [doi]
AB  - The rise of the novel COVID-19 virus has made face masks commonplace items aroundthe globe. Recent research found that face masks significantly impair emotionrecognition on isolated faces. However, faces are rarely seen in isolation andthe body is also a key cue for emotional portrayal. Here, therefore, weinvestigated the impact of face masks on emotion recognition when surveying thefull body. Stimuli expressing anger, happiness, sadness, and fear were selectedfrom the BEAST stimuli set. Masks were added to these images and participantswere asked to recognize the emotion and give a confidence level for that decisionfor both the masked and unmasked stimuli. We found that, contrary to some workviewing faces in isolation, emotion recognition was generally not impaired byface masks when the whole body is present. We did, however, find that whenviewing masked faces, only the recognition of happiness significantly decreasedwhen the whole body was present. In contrast to actual performance, confidencelevels were found to decline during the Mask condition across all emotionalconditions. This research suggests that the impact of masks on emotionrecognition may not be as pronounced as previously thought, as long as the whole body is also visible.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to examine which path among direct and indirecteffects was more influential to the quality of life (QOL) for patients with humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods: An observational study among 951individuals diagnosed with HIV was conducted in designated acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) medical institutions in Hangzhou using simplerandom sampling technique. We collected the demographic data of patients and thenevaluated their QOL by 12-Item Short-Form (SF-12) questionnaire survey. Thetwo-stage least squares analysis was firstly performed to filter the independent influencing factors of Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental ComponentSummary (MCS). We then enrolled the PCS, MCS, and their influencing factors into the path analysis of QOL, and further revealed the direct and indirect effects ofvariables and examined the important path that was more influential on thepatient's QOL. Results: The patient's PCS, MCS, and quality of life showed asignificant difference between groups in terms of education level and workingcondition (all P<0.05). Regression analysis showed that depression, age,education level, and treatment independently affected the PCS (all P<0.05), anddepression and anxiety exerted an independent effect on the MCS (all P<0.05).Further path analysis integrating related variables showed that the main indexes of the goodness of fit implied the final model fit the data well. The pathanalysis showed that PCS and MCS exerted direct effects on the QOL (all P<0.001),especially the MCS (beta=0.785), but other variables exerted no direct effects(all beta=0, all P>0.05). It should be noted that anxiety presented an obviousindirect effect on the QOL (beta=0.460), and its indirect effect was similar tothe direct effect of PCS (beta=0.471). Conclusion: The MCS might exert a moreimportant effect on the QOL of HIV patients. In addition, the indirect effect of anxiety on the QOL should not be ignored.

AB  - Vaginal cancer is a rare and uncommon disease that is rarely discussed. Although vaginal cancer traditionally occurs in older postmenopausal women, the incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers is increasing in younger women. Cervical cancer cells contain high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 proteins and inhibiting HPV gene expression leads the cells to stopproliferating and enter senescence. As E6, and E7 protein promoted thecarcinogenesis mechanism, and here not only regulate the cellular degradation of P53, and pRb but also enhances the cell proliferation along with E6 proteintargets the p53 for breakdown and subsequently promote the apoptotic cell death, and DNA repair inhibition, that is indispensable to the continue the lifecycle ofthe HPV. As a synchronous or metachronous tumor, vaginal cancer is frequentlyfound in combination with cervical cancer. It is uncertain what causes invasivefemale vaginal organ cancer. HPV type 16 is the most often isolated HPV type infemale vaginal organ cancers. Due to cancer's rarity, case studies have provided the majority of etiologic findings. Many findings demonstrate that ringpessaries, chronic vaginitis, sexual behavior, birth trauma, obesity, vaginalchemical exposure, and viruses are all risk factors. Because of insufficientunderstanding and disease findings, we are trying to find the disease's mechanismwith the available data. We also address different risk factors, therapy atvarious stages, diagnosis, and management of vaginal cancer in this review.

TI  - Development of Highly Sensitive Sandwich ELISA for the Early-Phase Diagnosis ofChikungunya Virus Utilizing rE2-E1 Protein.
PG  - 4065-4078
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S347545 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Chikungunya is caused by an alpha virus transmitted to humans by aninfected mosquito. Infection is generally considered to be self-limiting andnon-critical. Chikungunya infection may be diagnosed by severe joint pain withfever, but it is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of chikungunya arecommon to many pathogens, including dengue fever. Diagnosis mainly depends onviral culture, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and IgM ELISA. Early and accurate diagnosis of the virus can be achieved by theapplication of PCR methods, but the high cost and the need for a thermal cyclerrestrict the use of such methods. On the other hand, antibody-based IgM ELISA is considered to be inexpensive, but antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV)only develop after 4 days of infection, so it has limited application in theearlier diagnosis of viral infection and the management of patients. Because ofthese challenges, a simple antigen-based sensitive, specific, and rapid detectionmethod is required for the early and accurate clinical diagnosis of chikungunya. Methods: The amino acid sequence of CHIKV ectodomain E1 and E2 proteins wasanalyzed using bioinformatics tools to determine the antigenic residues,particularly the B-cell epitopes and their characteristics. Recombinant E2-E1CHIKV antigen was used for the development of polyclonal antibodies in hamstersand IgG was purified. Serological tests of 96 CHIKV patients were conducted byantigen-capture ELISA using primary antibodies raised against rCHIKV E2-E1 inhamsters and human anti-CHIKV antibodies. Results: We observed high specificityand sensitivity, of 100% and 95.8%, respectively, and these values demonstratethe efficiency of the test as a clinical diagnostic tool. There was nocross-reactivity with samples taken from dengue patients. Discussion: Our simple and sensitive sandwich ELISA for the early-phase detection of CHIKV infection maybe used to improve the diagnosis of chikungunya.

AB  - Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare systemic necrotizing vasculitis affectingsmall- to medium-sized arteries. The most common gastrointestinal manifestationof PAN is postprandial abdominal pain from mesenteric arteritis causing bowelischemia. When transmural ischemia develops, there may be ischemic necrosis andperforation of the bowel wall, which are life-threatening. Severe,life-threatening gastrointestinal involvement is relatively rare in pediatric PANand may require different management in adult patients. We report a pediatric PANcase in a patient who presented with acute abdominal pain and superimposedcytomegalovirus enteritis with jejunoileal perforation. The patient improved withemergency small intestinal resection followed by conventional immunosuppressivedrugs of a corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide, and anti-viral drugs. Beforeincreasing the immunosuppressive drug dosage, initial screening of infectiouscytomegalovirus and comprehensive evaluation for surgical conditions areessential in pediatric PAN with severe gastrointestinal involvement. Earlyaggressive treatment for acute abdomen is useful in reducing morbidity andmortality in pediatric PAN.

PG  - 911551
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.911551 [doi]
AB  - Background: Increased interferon (IFN)-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10) levelhas been shown to be associated with sustained virologic responses (SVRs) topegylated interferon-alpha 2a/ribavirin-based therapy in patients with chronichepatitis C (CHC). We investigated the relationship between IP-10 and treatmentresponse in patients with CHC treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) therapy. Methods: We measured the dynamic changes of IP-10 in samples from 90patients with CHC. The serum IP-10 levels, intrahepatic expressions of IP-10mRNA, and protein were determined, respectively. For the in vitro experiments,the expression changes of IP-10 in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-replicating Huh-7cells with or without non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor were analyzedusing real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Westernblotting. Results: Patients with chronic hepatitis C had increased baseline IP-10levels, intrahepatic IP-10 mRNA, and protein expression. After initiating DAAstherapy, serum IP-10 levels decreased gradually in patients who achieved cure,whereas in patients who failed the therapy, IP-10 levels did not changesignificantly or recovered from the initial decline. Multivariate logisticregression analysis confirmed that baseline IP-10 level </= 450 pg/ml and decline>30% at 12 weeks independently predicted the SVR in patients with CHC whoreceived DAAs. In vitro, the expression of IP-10 mRNA and protein inHCV-replicating Huh-7 cells increased significantly. However, such activitieswere downregulated by NS5A inhibitor, followed by the reduction of HCV RNA levelsand a decline in IP-10 levels. Conclusion: IP-10 interfered with HCV replication in hepatocytes and the dynamic decline in IP-10 levels during DAA treatmentpredicted the SVR in patients with CHC.

AB  - Objectives: Reinfection of human papillomavirus (HPV) among men who have sex withmen (MSM) after clearing the infection of HPV has not been well characterized. Tounderstand the reinfection of HPV among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)negative MSM without HPV vaccine, we analyzed the reinfection of nine-valent HPV vaccine (9v-HPV) types. Methods: Data were acquired from a prospective cohortstudy among HIV-negative MSM in Urumqi of Xinjiang from 1 April 2016 to 14 July2020. Participants were recruited through a local non-government organizationusing a website advertisement. Self-administered questionnaires andself-collected anal swabs were collected at baseline and every 6 months. Theincidence rates of reinfection was calculated based on the number of eventsdivided by person-months of observation of event risk. 95% confidence intervals(CIs) were calculated based on the Poisson distribution. Results: A total of 515 HIV-negative unvaccinated MSM were included with a mean age of 30.93 years (SD7.85), and 27.68% were reinfected with any 9v-HPV type after clearance. Thereinfection incidence rate of any 9v-HPV was 14.47 per 1000 person-months (95%CI: 11.52-17.87). HPV52 was the most common type of reinfection, with areinfection rate of 17.96 per 1,000 person months (95% CI: 11.58-26.33).Univariate analysis showed that MSM over the age of 30 had a slightly higher riskof reinfection with any 9v-HPV (Hazard ratio (HR): 1.57; 95% CI: 1.01-2.45), but no significant association was observed in multivariate analysis. Conclusions:Our study showed MSM without HPV vaccine will become reinfected following thenatural clearance of specific HPV types. It is also suggested that HPVvaccination is recommended not only prior to sexual debut but also after viralclearance for MSM to reduce HPV prevalence.

AB  - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexuallytransmitted infections worldwide. The current study aimed to investigate theprevalence and genotype distribution of HPV infection among outpatient-basedpopulations. A total of 40,613 women were recruited from the First People'sHospital of the Yunnan Province. Our study retrospectively analyzed the resultsof cervical HPV screening among 40,613 women. The results of study showed theprevalence and genotype distribution of HPV infection was different among variousoutpatient-based populations, and the prevalence of HPV infection was the highestin the gynecological outpatients (26.59%), followed by reproductive gynecologicaloutpatients (18.51%), and the prevalence of physically examined population wasthe lowest (8.15%). The outpatient-based population was facing a huge threat ofHPV infection, especially women from the gynecology clinic. The three most commonHPV genotypes were HPV-52 (4.79%), 16 (2.95%) and 58 (2.83%). However, thedistribution of HPV genotype varied by populations, especially in physicallyexamined population, the infection rate of HPV-81 ranked third among allinfections with various genotypes. Two peaks of prevalence of HPV infection were observed among women under 25 years (31.93%) and over 55 years (28.55%), whilethe prevalence in women aged 46-55 years (20.18%) was the lowest. Our study onthe prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV infection among variousoutpatient-based populations will provide scientific evidence for vaccinationstrategies of HPV and prevention and control plans of cervical cancer in Kunming area.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly impactedhealthcare, especially the nursing field. This study aims to explore the current status and hot topics of nursing-related research on COVID-19 using bibliometric analysis. Methods: Between 2019 and 2022, publications regarding nursing andCOVID-19 were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection. We conducted an advanced search using the following search query string: TS = ("Novel coronavirus2019" or "Coronavirus disease 2019" or "COVID 19" or "2019-nCOV" or "SARS-CoV-2" or "coronavirus-2") and TS = ("nursing" or "nurse" or "nursing-care" or"midwife"). Bibliometric parameters were extracted, and Microsoft Excel 2010 and VOSviewer were utilized to identify the largest contributors, including prolific authors, institutions, countries, and journals. VOSviewer and CiteSpace were usedto analyze the knowledge network, collaborative maps, hotspots, and trends inthis field. Results: A total of 5,267 papers were published between 2020 and2022. The findings are as follows: the USA, China, and the UK are the top threeprolific countries; the University of Toronto, the Harvard Medical School, theJohns Hopkins University, and the Huazhong University of Science & Technology arethe top four most productive institutions; Gravenstein, Stefan, and White,Elizabeth M. from Brown University (USA) are the most prolific authors; TheInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health is the mostproductive journal; "COVID-19," "SARS-CoV-2," "nurse," "mental health," "nursing home," "nursing education," "telemedicine," "vaccine-related issues" are thecentral topics in the past 2 years. Conclusion: Nursing-related research onCOVID-19 has gained considerable attention worldwide. In 2020, the major hottopics included "SARS-CoV-2," "knowledge," "information teaching," "mentalhealth," "psychological problems," and "nursing home." In 2021 and 2022,researchers were also interested in topics such as "nursing students,""telemedicine," and "vaccine-related issues," which require furtherinvestigation.

TI  - An Overview of Neurological and Psychiatric Complications During Post-COVIDPeriod: A Narrative Review.
PG  - 4199-4215
LID - 10.2147/JIR.S375494 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a multi-organ and multi-system diseasewith high morbidity and mortality in severe cases due to respiratory failure and severe cardiovascular events. However, the various manifestations of neurologicaland psychiatric (N/P) systems of COVID-19 should not be neglected. Some clinical studies have reported a high risk of N/P disorders in COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients and that their outcomes were positively associated with the diseaseseverity. These clinical manifestations could attribute to direct SARS-CoV-2invasion into the central nervous system (CNS), which is often complicated bysystemic hypoxia, the dysfunctional activity of the renin-angiotensin system and other relevant pathological changes. These changes may remain long term and mayeven lead to persistent post-COVID consequences on the CNS, such as memory,attention and focus issues, persistent headaches, lingering loss of smell andtaste, enduring muscle aches and chronic fatigue. Mild confusion and coma areserious adverse outcomes of neuropathological manifestations in COVID-19patients, which could be diversiform and vary at different stages of the clinicalcourse. Although lab investigations and neuro-imaging findings may help quantify the disease's risk, progress and prognosis, large-scale and persistentmulticenter clinical cohort studies are needed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19on the N/P systems. However, we used "Boolean Operators" to search for relevantresearch articles, reviews and clinical trials from PubMed and the ClinicalTrialsdataset for "COVID-19 sequelae of N/P systems during post-COVID periods" with thetime frame from December 2019 to April 2022, only found 42 in 254,716COVID-19-related articles and 2 of 7931 clinical trials involved N/P sequelaeduring post-COVID periods. Due to the increasing number of infected cases and theincessant mutation characteristics of this virus, diagnostic and therapeuticguidelines for N/P manifestations should be further refined.

PG  - 962438
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.962438 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a leading cause of worldwide agriculturalloss. ASFV is a highly contagious and lethal disease for both domestic and wildpigs, which has brought enormous economic losses to a number of countries.Conventional methods, such as general polymerase chain reaction and isothermalamplification, are time-consuming, instrument-dependent, and unsatisfactorilyaccurate. Therefore, rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable detection of ASFV is important for disease surveillance and control. Herein, we created a one-potvisual detection system for ASFV with CRISPR/Cas12a technology combined with LAMPor RPA. A mineral oil sealing strategy was adopted to mitigate samplecross-contamination between parallel vials during high-throughput testing.Furthermore, the blue fluorescence signal produced by ssDNA reporter could beobserved by the naked eye without any dedicated instrument. For CRISPR-RPAsystem, detection could be completed within 40 min with advantageous sensitivity.While CRISPR-LAMP system could complete it within 60 min with a high sensitivity of 5.8 x 10(2) copies/mul. Furthermore, we verified such detection platformsdisplay no cross-reactivity with other porcine DNA or RNA viruses. BothCRISPR-RPA and CRISPR-LAMP systems permit highly rapid, sensitive, specific, and low-cost Cas12a-mediated visual diagnostic of ASFV for point-of-care testing(POCT) applications.

AB  - Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of cells that are present in allvertebrate tissues. They play a key role in the innate immune system, and thus,in vitro cultures of macrophages provide a valuable model for exploring theirtissue-specific functions and interactions with pathogens. Porcine macrophagecultures are often used for the identification and characterization of porcineviral pathogens. Recently, we have developed a simple and efficient method forisolating primary macrophages from the kidneys and livers of swine. Here, weapplied this protocol to fetal porcine intestinal tissues and demonstrated thatporcine intestinal macrophages (PIM) can be isolated from mixed primary cultures of porcine small intestine-derived cells. Since the proliferative capacity ofprimary PIM is limited, we attempted to immortalize them by transferring the SV40large T antigen and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase genes usinglentiviral vectors. Consequently, immortalized PIM (IPIM) were successfullygenerated and confirmed to retain various features of primary PIM. We furtherrevealed that IPIM are susceptible to infection by the African swine fever virus and the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and support theirreplication. These findings suggest that the IPIM cell line is a useful tool for developing in vitro models that mimic the intestinal mucosal microenvironments ofswine, and for studying the interactions between porcine pathogens and hostimmune cells.

TI  - Decision-making Among Hepatitis C Virus-negative Transplant Candidates OfferedOrgans from Donors with HCV Infection.
PG  - e1341
LID - 10.1097/TXD.0000000000001341 [doi]
AB  - Background: Historically, many organs from deceased donors with hepatitis C virus(HCV) were discarded. The advent of highly curative direct-acting antiviral (DAA)therapies motivated transplant centers to conduct trials of transplantingHCV-viremic organs (nucleic acid amplification test positive) into HCV-negativerecipients, followed by DAA treatment. However, the factors that influencecandidates' decisions regarding acceptance of transplant with HCV-viremic organs are not well understood. Methods: To explore patient-level perceptions,influences, and experiences that inform candidate decision-making regardingtransplant with organs from HCV-viremic donors, we conducted a qualitativesemistructured interview study embedded within 3 clinical trials investigatingthe safety and efficacy of transplanting lungs and kidneys from HCV-viremicdonors into HCV-negative recipients. The study was conducted from June 2019 toMarch 2021. Results: Among 44 HCV-negative patients listed for organ transplantwho were approached for enrollment in the applicable clinical trial, 3 approachesto decision-making emerged: positivist, risk analyses, and instinctual response. Perceptions of risk contributed to conceptualizations of factors influencingdecisions. Moreover, most participants relied on multiple decision-makingapproaches, either simultaneously or sequentially. Conclusions: Understanding howdifferent decisional models influence patients' choices regarding transplant withorgans from HCV-viremic donors may promote shared decision-making amongtransplant patients and providers.

TI  - Inhibition of Glycolysis Impairs Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I-MediatedAntiviral Responses in Primary Human Dendritic Cells.
PG  - 910864
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.910864 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are important mediators of the induction and regulation of adaptive immune responses following microbial infection and inflammation. Sensingenvironmental danger signals including viruses, microbial products, orinflammatory stimuli by DCs leads to the rapid transition from a resting state toan activated mature state. DC maturation involves enhanced capturing andprocessing of antigens for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)class I and class II, upregulation of chemokines and their receptors, cytokinesand costimulatory molecules, and migration to lymphoid tissues where they primenaive T cells. Orchestrating a cellular response to environmental threatsrequires a high bioenergetic cost that accompanies the metabolic reprogramming ofDCs during activation. We previously demonstrated that DCs undergo a strikingfunctional transition after stimulation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I(RIG-I) pathway with a synthetic 5' triphosphate containing RNA (termed M8),consisting of the upregulation of interferon (IFN)-stimulated antiviral genes,increased DC phagocytosis, activation of a proinflammatory phenotype, andinduction of markers associated with immunogenic cell death. In the presentstudy, we set out to determine the metabolic changes associated with RIG-Istimulation by M8. The rate of glycolysis in primary human DCs was increased inresponse to RIG-I activation, and glycolytic reprogramming was an essentialrequirement for DC activation. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis inmonocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) impaired type I IFN induction andsignaling by disrupting the TBK1-IRF3-STAT1 axis, thereby countering theantiviral activity induced by M8. Functionally, the impaired IFN responseresulted in enhanced viral replication of dengue, coronavirus 229E, and CoxsackieB5.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a constant threat to human beings and the world economy for more than two years. Vaccination is the first choice tocontrol and prevent the pandemic. However, an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccineagainst the virus infection is still needed. This study designed and preparedfour kinds of virus-like particles (VLPs) using an insect expression system. Two constructs encoded wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) fused with or without H5N1matrix 1 (M1) (S and SM). The other two constructs contained a codon-optimizedspike gene and/or M1 gene (mS and mSM) based on protein expression, stability,and ADE avoidance. The results showed that the VLP-based vaccine could inducehigh SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in mice, including specific IgG, IgG1, andIgG2a. Moreover, the mSM group has the most robust ability to stimulate humoralimmunity and cellular immunity than the other VLPs, suggesting the mSM is thebest immunogen. Further studies showed that the mSM combined with Al/CpG adjuvantcould stimulate animals to produce sustained high-level antibodies and establish an effective protective barrier to protect mice from challenges withmouse-adapted strain. The vaccine based on mSM and Al/CpG adjuvant is a promisingcandidate vaccine to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) clinical manifestations in children and adolescents are diverse, despite the respiratory condition being themain presentation. Factors such as comorbidities and other respiratory infectionsmay play a role in the initial presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aims to describe theepidemiological aspects, clinical, and laboratory manifestations of pediatricpatients admitted to a tertiary pediatric hospital in Rio de Janeiro, diagnosedwith COVID-19, and compare these with other viral conditions during the firstyear of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: All patients under 18 years of age thatwere admitted with upper airway infection were enrolled and followed up for 30days. The main dependent variable was the laboratorial diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2,and independent variables were studied through logistic regression. Results: Atotal of 533 patients were recruited, and 105 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Detection of other viruses occurred in 34% of 264 tested participants. Sixpatients died (two in SARS-CoV-2 infected group). The variables independentlyassociated with COVID-19 were older age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0-1.1), lowerleukocytes count at entry (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-0.9), and contact withsuspected case (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.0-2.6). Patients with COVID-19 presentedhigher odds to be admitted in an intensive care unit (OR = 1.99, 95% CI =1.08-3.66). Conclusions: Even during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several otherrespiratory viruses were present in admitted pediatric patients. Variablesassociated with COVID-19 infection were older age, lower leukocytes count atentry, and a domiciliary suspect contact. Although patients with COVID-19 weremore frequently admitted to ICU, we did not observe higher mortality in thisgroup.

LID - 10.1039/d2sd00076h [doi]
AB  - Graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) biosensors exhibit high sensitivity dueto a large surface-to-volume ratio and the high sensitivity of the Fermi level tothe presence of charged biomolecules near the surface. For most reported GFETbiosensors, bulky external reference electrodes are used which prevent theirfull-scale chip integration and contribute to higher costs per test. In thisstudy, GFET arrays with on-chip integrated liquid electrodes were employed forCOVID-19 detection and functionalized with either antibody or aptamer toselectively bind the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. In the case of theaptamer-functionalized GFET (aptasensor, Apt-GFET), the limit-of-detection (LOD) achieved was about 10(3) particles per mL for virus-like particles (VLPs) inclinical transport medium, outperforming the Ab-GFET biosensor counterpart. Inaddition, the aptasensor achieved a LOD of 160 aM for COVID-19 neutralizingantibodies in serum. The sensors were found to be highly selective, fast(sample-to-result within minutes), and stable (low device-to-device signalvariation; relative standard deviations below 0.5%). A home-built portablereadout electronic unit was employed for simultaneous real-time measurements of12 GFETs per chip. Our successful demonstration of a portable GFET biosensingplatform has high potential for infectious disease detection and otherhealth-care applications.

TI  - An Epidemiological Study of Outbreak Investigation of Chickenpox in RemoteHamlets of a Tribal State in India.
PG  - e26454
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chickenpox is a benign, self-limiting disease caused by thevaricella-zoster virus (VZV) that is transmitted from person to person withdirect contact or airborne spread, which usually lasts for five to seven days.There was a sudden increase in the number of cases of fever along with rashes at two sites in Jharkhand, India. We aimed to survey and establish the etiology and investigate the extent of the disease. METHODS: We defined the case of chickenpoxas a person with acute onset of diffuse maculo-papulovesicular rash. From theclinically suspected cases, blood samples were collected and tested for anti-VZV immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies (depending on the clinicalfeatures) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (NovatecImmundiagnostica GmbH, Dietzenbach, Germany). A detailed history was collectedfrom each case including the history of contacts and immunization status.RESULTS: The outbreak investigations were done at two villages of the twodifferent blocks and one school in the Bharno block. According to the casedefinition, 16 persons were found affected by the varicella-zoster/chickenpoxinfection who belonged to five different households of Itkhori village in Chatra district. The age group varied from four to 45 years. The mean age was 20.28years. Out of 16 cases, 10 (62.5%) cases complained of fever, rashes, anditching, two (12.5%) reported rashes and fever, and four (25%) complained ofitching along with rashes. While at the Bharno block of Gumla district, out of 62cases that fulfilled the case definition, 55 (88.7%) cases complained of fever,rashes, and itching, two (3.2%) reported itching and rashes, one (1.6%) reported vomiting along with fever and rashes, one (1.6%) complained about pain andrashes, one (1.6%) complained of cough with rashes, and four (25%) complained of itching along with rashes. There was neither any death nor any seriouscomplication noted due to varicella. CONCLUSION: Chickenpox is still widespreadin Northern parts of India like Jharkhand. Most of the cases were self-limitingand recovered at the Itkhori block, while at the Bharno block, there were 20active cases and the rest were either recovered or were still in the recoveryphase.

TI  - Boosting the Understanding and Approval of Anti-Corona Measures-ReducingExponential Growth Bias and its Effects through Educational Nudges.
PG  - 809-821
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12479 [doi]
AB  - One major problem of compliance with anti-coronavirus measures originates fromthe so-called exponential growth bias, i.e. the cognitive distortion ofsystematically underestimating exponential growth and its consequences. Wereplicate an Amazon MTurk experiment regarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 that was conducted in the general US population during the first wave of the pandemic inMarch 2020 dealing with this bias. Using a least-likely-design-approach, we find a similarly strong bias in our sample of German students in November 2020.Nevertheless, this bias can be reduced by one simple educational intervention.Furthermore, participants who received these educational nudges showed aconsiderably higher approval rating for contact restrictions. This effect isrobust to different analytical techniques and the inclusion of controls.Complementing political statements about the exponential spread of the virus -which often only mention the name of the phenomenon - with simple educationalnudges could help the public better understand the need for encroachments onpersonal liberties.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijregi.2022.07.006 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Health Department retrospectively reportedsix cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) from a cohort of febrile patients during outbreaksof dengue and malaria in 2016. However, the transmission of ZIKV remains unclear due to lack of testing capability. This study aimed to determine the level ofimmunity to ZIKV among PNG military personnel (PNGMP) in 2019. Methods: Sera of208 PNGMP recruited in April 2019 was tested for the presence of anti-ZIKVimmunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) antibodies using Euroimmun IgG/IgM detectionkits, and anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibody (Nab) against a ZIKV African strain on all anti-ZIKV-IgG/IgM(+) samples. Results: Anti-ZIKV seropositivity of these serawas as follows: IgG, 67%; IgM, 9%; and Nab, 65%. Five of 19 anti-ZIKV-IgM(+)samples had anti-ZIKV-Nab titres >/=20, as well as an anti-ZIKV-Nab titre ratio>/=4 compared with the Nab titres of four anti-dengue serotypes, so met thecriteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) for confirmed ZIKV infection.Conclusions: The prevalence of anti-ZIKV-Nab of 65% suggests that there are high levels of ZIKV exposure among PNGMP. Five of the 19 anti-ZIKV-IgM(+) samples met the WHO criteria for confirmed ZIKV infection, suggesting a recent undetectedoutbreak in PNGMP. These results provide better understanding of the current ZIKVepidemic status in PNGMP.

LID - 10.32607/actanaturae.11623 [doi]
AB  - The resistance of glioblastoma to existing therapies puts limits onquality-of-life improvements and patient survival with a glioblastoma diagnosis. The development of new effective glioblastoma therapies is based on knowledgeabout the mechanisms governing tumor resistance to therapeutic agents.Virotherapy is one of the most actively developing approaches to the treatment ofmalignant neoplasms: glioblastoma in particular. Previously, we demonstrated thatthe recombinant vaccinia virus VV-GMCSF-Lact exhibits in vitro cytotoxic activityand in vivo antitumor efficacy against human glioblastoma. However, the studiedglioblastoma cell cultures had different sensitivities to the oncotoxic effect ofthe virus. In this study, we investigated cancer stem cell (CSC) surface markers in glioblastoma cells with different sensitivities to VV-GMCSFLact using flowcytometry and we assessed the levels of proteins affecting viral entry into cellsand virus infection efficiency by western blotting. We showed that cell cultures more sensitive to VV-GMCSF-Lact are characterized by a greater number of cellswith CSC markers and a lower level of activated Akt kinase. Akt probably inhibitslactaptin-induced apoptosis in virus-resistant cells. Hence, we suggest that the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to the oncotoxic effect of VV-GMCSF-Lact isdetermined by the nature and extent of the disturbances in cell death regulation in various cultures. Further investigation of the factors affecting glioblastoma resistance to virotherapy will test this hypothesis and identify targets forantitumor therapy, combined with VV-GMCSF-Lact.

LID - 10.7759/cureus.26504 [doi]
AB  - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an autoimmune phenomenoncharacterized by reactive hyperactivity of cytotoxic T cells and histiocytes,leading to hypercytokinemic injury to cells and organ system, which leads tomultiorgan dysfunction and ultimate failure. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is mostcommonly associated with secondary HLH with high mortality, but increasingevidence suggests the association of the dengue virus. When associated withdengue infection, it carries a grave prognosis and correlates with the diseaseseverity. Furthermore, it overlaps with dengue sepsis, so it can often bemisdiagnosed as sepsis. Typically the patients have hyperferritinemia,hypertriglyceridemia, transaminitis, and marrow features suggestive ofhemophagocytosis. The treatment is usually systemic corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and chemotherapy with etoposide. We present a case of a25-year-old male patient who had a dengue infection and further developed HLHwith pulmonary infiltrates. Clinical suspicion alerted us to look for otherevidence of HLH on the fourth day of admission, and appropriate investigationswere done. Diagnosis of HLH was confirmed by HLH-2004, HScore criteria, and bone marrow aspirate examination. Treatment was given in the form of corticosteroidsand chemotherapy along with other supportive measures. The patient responded tothe line of management.

AB  - Qualitative and quantitative PCR-based tests are widely used in both diagnostics and research to assess the prevalence of disease-causing pathogens in veterinary medicine. The efficacy of these tests, usually measured in terms of sensitivityand specificity, is critical in confirming or excluding a clinical diagnosis. We undertook a meta-analysis to assess the inherent value of published PCRdiagnostic approaches used to confirm and quantify bacteria and virusesassociated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in cattle. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)guidelines. A thorough search of nine electronic databases (Web of Science,EBSCOhost, Cambridge journals online, ProQuest, PubMed, Sage journals online,ScienceDirect, Wiley online library and MEDLINE) was undertaken to find studiesthat had reported on the use of PCR and/or qPCR for the detection and/orquantification of BRD associated organisms. All studies meeting the inclusioncriteria for reporting quantitative PCR for identification of BRD associatedmicroorganisms were included in the analysis. Studies were then assessed on theapplications of the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-TimePCR Experiment (MIQE) and PCR primer/probe sequences were extracted and testedfor in silico specificity using a high level of stringency. Fourteen full-textarticles were included in this study. Of these, 79% of the analysed articles did not report the application of the MIQE guidelines in their study. High stringencyin silico testing of 144 previously published PCR primer/probe sequences foundmany to have questionable specificity. This review identified a high occurrenceof primer/probe sequences with a variable in silico specificity such that thismay have implications for the accuracy of reporting. Although this analysis wasonly applied to one specific disease state, identification of animals suspectedto be suffering from bovine respiratory disease, there appears to be more broadlya need for veterinary diagnostic studies to adopt international best practice forreporting of quantitative PCR diagnostic data to be both accurate and comparable between studies and methodologies.

PG  - 884600
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.884600 [doi]
AB  - Background: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) increased rapidly inthe last 20 years. Although related research has developed rapidly, little isknown about its etiology, diagnostic marker, or drug treatment, which forcesresearchers to review and summarize its development process and look for thefuture development direction. Methods: We used bibliometrics to analyze papers ofASD in the Web of Science from 1998 to 2021, to draw the network of authors,institutions, countries, and keywords in the ASD field, and visualize theresults. Results: A total of 40,597 papers were included with a continuallyincreasing trend. It turns out that the research on ASD is mainly concentrated inuniversities. The United States has the largest number of ASD studies, followedby England and Canada. The quality of papers related to ASD is generally high,which shows that ASD research has become a hot spot of scientific research. Thekeywords of ASD etiology and diagnostic markers can be classified into at least 7aspects. The detection of keywords shows that ASD research is mostly based on itssubtypes, takes children as the study population, focuses on neurodevelopmentalimaging or genetics, and pays attention to individual differences. And ASDresearch has changed greatly under the impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in thepast 2 years. Conclusion: We consider the future development direction should be based on the improvement of case identification, accurate clinical phenotype,large-scale cohort study, the discovery of ASD etiology and diagnostic markers,drug randomized controlled trials, and telehealth.

TI  - Estimating the burden of hepatitis B virus infection in Laos between 2020 and2021: A cross-sectional seroprevalence survey.
PG  - 101582
LID - 10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101582 [doi]
AB  - Background: Laos is considered highly endemic for persistent infection withhepatitis B virus (HBV). To eliminate this burden, it has gradually implementeduniversal anti-hepatitis B immunisation of newborns over the past two decades.Methods: Using VIKIA(R) HBsAg, a rapid test for the qualitative detection of the HBV surface antigen, we conducted between Sep 1st, 2020 and Aug 31st, 2021 thelargest prospective prevalence survey ever in Laos. This survey included blooddonors (BD, n = 42,277), patients attending care in capital and provincialhospitals (n = 37,347) including attending mothers (n = 20,548), HIV-infectedpatients (n = 7439, recruited from 2009 to 2020), students from the HealthSciences University (n = 609), and outpatients (n = 350) coming for diagnosis at the Center Infectiology Lao-Christophe Merieux in Vientiane. In total, 88,022persons were tested, representing approximately 1.22% of the national population.To reach a reasonable estimate of HBsAg prevalence in Laos, we segmented thepopulation according to three variables, age (</=20 years as a cut-off), sex, andgeographical origin. BD values were used to estimate HBsAg prevalence in patientsaged <20 while hospital survey prevalence was used to estimate the prevalence in those aged older than 20 years. Findings: We observed an HBsAg seroprevalenceranging from 2.6% in blood donors to 8.0% in HIV-infected patients. In BD, menwere significantly more at risk to be carriers than women (RR = 1.2, P =0.00063). For BD, attending mothers, or HIV-infected patients, HBsAg wassignificantly more prevalent in northern Laos (5.1-8.4%) than in central(2.0-8.1%) or southern parts of the country (2.2-6.9%), thereby delineating aNorth-to-South gradient. Interpretation: We considered that HBsAg prevalenceprobably ranges between 5.0% and 6.0% of the total population. Thus, we consider that Laos may no longer be highly endemic for chronic HBV infection but rather a country with intermediate endemicity. Funding: The funding sources were theAgence Universitaire de la Francophonie, the French Government, the FrenchInstitute for Sustainable Development (IRD), and European Union's Horizon 2020Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) - Research and Innovation Staff Exchange - (RISE) under grant agreement N degrees 823935.

AB  - Bioaerosol sampling is an essential and integral part of any bioaerosolinvestigation. Since bioaerosols are very diverse in terms of their sizes,species, biological properties, and requirements for their detection andquantification, bioaerosol sampling is an active, yet challenging research area. This paper was inspired by the discussions during the 2018 International Aerosol Conference (IAC) (St. Louis, MO) regarding the need to summarize the currentstate of the art in bioaerosol research, including bioaerosol sampling, and theneed to develop a more standardized set of guidelines for protocols used inbioaerosol research. The manuscript is a combination of literature review andperspectives: it discusses the main bioaerosol sampling techniques and thenoverviews the latest technical developments in each area; the overview isfollowed by the discussion of the emerging trends and developments in the field, including personal sampling, application of passive samplers, and advances towardimproving bioaerosol detection limits as well as the emerging challenges such as collection of viruses and collection of unbiased samples for bioaerosolsequencing. The paper also discusses some of the practical aspects of bioaerosol sampling with particular focus on sampling aspects that could lead to bioaerosol determination bias. The manuscript concludes by suggesting several goals forbioaerosol sampling and development community to work towards and describes some of the grand bioaerosol challenges discussed at the IAC 2018.

TI  - Lagovirus Non-structural Protein p23: A Putative Viroporin That Interacts WithHeat Shock Proteins and Uses a Disulfide Bond for Dimerization.
PG  - 923256
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.923256 [doi]
AB  - The exact function(s) of the lagovirus non-structural protein p23 is unknown asrobust cell culture systems for the Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and other lagoviruses have not been established. Instead, a range of in vitro and in silico models have been used to study p23, revealing that p23 oligomerizes,accumulates in the cytoplasm, and possesses a conserved C-terminal region withtwo amphipathic helices. Furthermore, the positional homologs of p23 in othercaliciviruses have been shown to possess viroporin activity. Here, we report onthe mechanistic details of p23 oligomerization. Site-directed mutagenesisrevealed the importance of an N-terminal cysteine for dimerization. Furthermore, we identified cellular interactors of p23 using stable isotope labeling withamino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics; heat shock proteins Hsp70and 110 interact with p23 in transfected cells, suggesting that they 'chaperone' p23 proteins before their integration into cellular membranes. We investigatedchanges to the global transcriptome and proteome that occurred in infected rabbitliver tissue and observed changes to the misfolded protein response, calciumsignaling, and the regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. Finally,flow cytometry studies indicate slightly elevated calcium concentrations in thecytoplasm of p23-transfected cells. Taken together, accumulating evidencesuggests that p23 is a viroporin that might form calcium-conducting channels inthe ER membranes.

AB  - Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American Foulbrood (AFB), ahighly contagious and worldwide spread bacterial disease that affects honeybeebrood. In this study, all complete P. larvae genomes available on the NCBIdatabase were analyzed in order to detect presence of prophages using the PHASTERsoftware. A total of 55 intact prophages were identified in 11 P. larvae genomes (5.0 +/- 2.3 per genome) and were further investigated for the presence of genes encoding relevant traits related to P. larvae. A closer look at the prophagegenomes revealed the presence of several putative genes such as metabolic andantimicrobial resistance genes, toxins or bacteriocins, potentially influencinghost performance. Some of the coding DNA sequences (CDS) were present in allERIC-genotypes, while others were only found in a specific genotype. While CDSencoding toxins and antitoxins such as HicB and MazE were found in prophages ofall bacterial genotypes, others, from the same category, were provided byprophages particularly to ERIC I (enhancin-like toxin), ERIC II (antitoxin SocA) and ERIC V strains (subunit of Panton-Valentine leukocidin system (PVL) LukF-PV).This is the first in-depth analysis of P. larvae prophages. It provides betterknowledge on their impact in the evolution of virulence and fitness of P. larvae,by discovering new features assigned by the viruses.

TI  - Identification and Implications of HIV-1 CRF01_AE Subtype in Hawai'i.
PG  - 215-217
AB  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus has a high propensity for genetic variation,demonstrated by its complex phylogeny and multiplicity of subtypes. Subtype B is predominant in North America as well as in Hawai'i while CRF01_AE is found inover 50% of cases in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. In a small collaborativestudy between the Hawai'i Center for AIDS and Philippines General Hospital,molecular phylogenetic subtyping was conducted on HIV+ participants. Two of 15(13%) participants from the Hawai'i cohort and 12 of 21 (57%) participants fromthe Philippines cohort were identified as having CRF01_AE subtype of HIV-1, with remaining participants identified as subtype B. While one individual in Hawai'iwith CRF01_AE had emigrated from the Philippines, the other participant fromHawai'i with CRF01_AE subtype was a local individual, born and raised in Hawai'i.The authors report that HIV subtype diversity may be increased in Hawai'i anddiscuss its potential clinical and public health implications.

PG  - 353-368
LID - 10.1111/spsr.12466 [doi]
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic severely threatens refugees: Most refugees live indeveloping countries with poor health care systems, the lockdowns left manyrefugees without income, border closures prevented forced migrants from theirright to seek asylum and anti-refugee sentiment as well as insecurity in refugee settlements increased. Building on past refugee research and reports onrefugee-related challenges during the Covid-19 crisis, we explain how badsanitation, inadequate accommodation, additional restrictions of movement andemployment and language barriers increase grievances among refugees and tensions between refugees and host populations. Particularly in large and overcrowdedsettlements these issues can lead to violent conflict, as we demonstrate with acase study of the Moria refugee camp in Greece. Yet, the impact of Covid-19 onrefugees generally lacks politicization, and many governments are reluctant orunable to provide adequate housing and sanitation to refugees. We present policy recommendations for improving refugee protection amidst Covid-19, including notonly the prevention of further spread of the virus but also that of insecurity.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has had an unprecedented impact on human health and highlights theneed for genomic epidemiology studies to increase our understanding of theevolution and spread of pathogens and to inform policy decisions. Most effortshave focused on international or country-wide transmission, which are unable tohighlight state-wide trends. We sequenced virus genomes from over 22,000 patientstested at Mayo Clinic Laboratories between 2020-2022 and leveraged detailedpatient metadata to describe county-to-county spread in Minnesota. Our findingsindicate that spread in the state was mostly dominated by viruses from HennepinCounty, which contains the largest metropolis. For many counties, we found thatstate government restrictions eventually led to a decrease in the diversity ofcirculating viruses from other counties and that their complete removal in May of2021 saw a drastic revert to levels at or greater than those observed during the months before. We also linked over 14,000 genomes with patient riskcharacteristics and infection-related phenotypes from the Mayo Clinic electronic health record. We found that the genetic relationship of Omicron viruses wasstructured by clinical outcomes when stratifying by patient risk factor andvariant of concern. However, we were unable to identify nucleotide variants that drove this association.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) global pandemic continuous to infect and kill millions while rapidly evolving new variants that are more transmissible and evadingvaccine-elicited antibodies. Artemisia annua L. extracts have shown potencyagainst all previously tested variants. Here we further queried extract efficacy against omicron and its recent subvariants. Using Vero E6 cells, we measured the in vitro efficacy (IC 50 ) of stored (frozen) dried-leaf hot-water A. annua L.extracts of four cultivars (A3, BUR, MED, and SAM) against SARS-CoV-2 variants:original WA1 (WT), BA.1.1.529+R346K (omicron), BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4. IC 50values normalized to the extract artemisinin (ART) content ranged from 0.5-16.5microM ART. When normalized to dry mass of the extracted A. annua leaves, values ranged from 20-106 microg. Although IC 50 values for these new variants areslightly higher than those reported for previously tested variants, they werewithin limits of assay variation. There was no measurable loss of cell viability at leaf dry weights </=50 microg of any cultivar extract. Results continue toindicate that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts (tea infusions)could potentially provide a cost-effective approach to help stave off thispandemic virus and its rapidly evolving variants.

LID - 2022.07.25.501353 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2022.07.25.501353 [doi]
AB  - Plus-strand RNA viruses are the largest group of viruses. Many are humanpathogens that inflict a socio-economic burden. Interestingly, plus-strand RNAviruses share remarkable similarities in their replication. A hallmark ofplus-strand RNA viruses is the remodeling of intracellular membranes to establishreplication organelles (so-called "replication factories"), which provide aprotected environment for the replicase complex, consisting of the viral genomeand proteins necessary for viral RNA synthesis. In the current study, weinvestigate pan-viral similarities and virus-specific differences in the lifecycle of this highly relevant group of viruses. We first measured the kinetics ofviral RNA, viral protein, and infectious virus particle production of hepatitis Cvirus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in theimmuno-compromised Huh7 cell line and thus without perturbations by an intrinsic immune response. Based on these measurements, we developed a detailedmathematical model of the replication of HCV, DENV, and CVB3 and show that onlysmall virus-specific changes in the model were necessary to describe the in vitrodynamics of the different viruses. Our model correctly predicted virus-specificmechanisms such as host cell translation shut off and different kinetics ofreplication organelles. Further, our model suggests that the ability to suppress or shut down host cell mRNA translation may be a key factor for in vitroreplication efficiency which may determine acute self-limited or chronicinfection. We further analyzed potential broad-spectrum antiviral treatmentoptions in silico and found that targeting viral RNA translation, especiallypolyprotein cleavage, and viral RNA synthesis may be the most promising drugtargets for all plus-strand RNA viruses. Moreover, we found that targeting onlythe formation of replicase complexes did not stop the viral replication in vitro early in infection, while inhibiting intracellular trafficking processes may evenlead to amplified viral growth. Author summary: Plus-strand RNA viruses comprise a large group of related and medically relevant viruses. The current globalpandemic of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-coronavirus-2 as well as the constantspread of diseases such as dengue and chikungunya fever show the necessity of acomprehensive and precise analysis of plus-strand RNA virus infections.Plus-strand RNA viruses share similarities in their life cycle. To understandtheir within-host replication strategies, we developed a mathematical model that studies pan-viral similarities and virus-specific differences of threeplus-strand RNA viruses, namely hepatitis C, dengue, and coxsackievirus. Byfitting our model to in vitro data, we found that only small virus-specificvariations in the model were required to describe the dynamics of all threeviruses. Furthermore, our model predicted that ribosomes involved in viral RNAtranslation seem to be a key player in plus-strand RNA replication efficiency,which may determine acute or chronic infection outcome. Furthermore, ourin-silico drug treatment analysis suggests that targeting viral proteasesinvolved in polyprotein cleavage, in combination with viral RNA replication, may represent promising drug targets with broad-spectrum antiviral activity.

AB  - Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we have witnessed a revolution invaccine development with the rapid emergence and deployment of both traditionaland novel vaccine platforms. The inactivated CoronaVac vaccine and the mRNA-basedPfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine are among the most widely distributed vaccines, bothdemonstrating high, albeit variable, vaccine effectiveness against severeCOVID-19 over time. Beyond the ability of the vaccines to generate neutralizingantibodies, antibodies can attenuate disease via their ability to recruit thecytotoxic and opsinophagocytic functions of the immune response. However, whetherFc-effector functions are induced differentially, wane with different kinetics,and are boostable, remains unknown. Here, using systems serology, we profiled theFc-effector profiles induced by the CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccines, over time.Despite the significantly higher antibody functional responses induced by theBNT162b2 vaccine, CoronaVac responses waned more slowly, albeit still found atlevels below those present in the systemic circulation of BNT162b2 immunizedindividuals. However, mRNA boosting of the CoronaVac vaccine responses resultedin the induction of significantly higher peak antibody functional responses with increased humoral breadth, including to Omicron. Collectively, the data presentedhere point to striking differences in vaccine platform-induced functional humoralimmune responses, that wane with different kinetics, and can be functionallyrescued and expanded with boosting.

AB  - The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to be primed for viral entry by the host cell protease furin has become one of the most investigated of the numerous transmission andpathogenicity features of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 The variant B.1.1.529 (Omicron)emerged in late 2020 and has continued to evolve and is now present in severaldistinct sub-variants. Here, we analyzed the "furin cleavage site" of the spikeprotein of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron variant) in vitro , to assess the roleof two key mutations (spike, N679K and P681H) that are common across allsubvariants compared to the ancestral B.1 virus and other notable lineages. Weobserved significantly increased intrinsic cleavability with furin compared to anoriginal B lineage virus (Wuhan-Hu1), as well as to two variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha)and B.1.617 (Delta) that subsequently had wide circulation. Increasedfurin-mediated cleavage was attributed to the N679K mutation, which lies outside the conventional furin binding pocket. Our findings suggest that B.1.1.529(Omicron variant) has gained genetic features linked to intrinsic furincleavability, in line with its evolution within the population as the COVID-19pandemic has proceeded.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unsegmentedpositivesense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the beta-coronavirus .This virus was the cause of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2019(COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan, China at the early stage of the pandemic andrapidly spread around the world. Rapid transmission and reproduction ofSARS-CoV-2 threaten worldwide health with a high mortality rate from the virus.According to the significant role of non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) ininhibiting host mRNA translation, this study focuses on the link between aminoacid sequences of NSP1 and alterations of them spreading around the world. TheSARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein sequences were analyzed and FASTA files were processed byPython language programming libraries. Reference sequences compared with eachNSP1 sample to identify every mutation and categorize them were based oncontinents and frequencies. NSP1 mutations rate divided into continents weredifferent. Based on continental studies, E87D in global vision and also in Europenotably increased. The E87D mutation has significantly risen especially in thelast months of the study as the first frequent mutation observed. The remarkable mutations, H110Y and R24C, have the second and third frequencies, respectively.Based on this mutational information, despite NSP1 being a conserved sequenceoccurrence, these mutations change the rate of flexibility and stability of theNSP1 protein, which can eventually affect inhibiting the host translation.IMPORTANCE: In this study, we analyzed 6,510,947 sequences of non-structuralprotein 1 as a conserved region of SARS-CoV-2. According to the obtained results,93.4819% of samples had no mutant regions on their amino acid sequences. Heat mapdata of mutational samples demonstrated high percentages of mutations thatoccurred in the region of 72 to 126 amino acids indicating a hot spot region ofthe protein. Increased rates of E87D, H110Y, and R24C mutations in the timelineof our study were reported as significant compared to available mutant samples.Analyzing the details of replacing amino acids in the most frequent E87D mutationreveals the role of this alteration in increasing molecule flexibility anddestabilizing the structure of the protein.

AB  - Since the initial emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, several Omicronsublineages have emerged, leading to BA.5 as the current dominant sublineage.Here we report the neutralization of different Omicron sublineages by human sera collected from individuals who had distinct mRNA vaccination and/or BA.1infection. Four-dose-vaccine sera neutralize the original USA-WA1/2020, OmicronBA.1, BA.2, BA.212.1, BA.3, and BA.4/5 viruses with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 1554, 357, 236, 236, 165, and 95, respectively;2-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection sera exhibit GMTs of 2114, 1705, 730, 961,813, and 274, respectively; and 3-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection sera show GMTsof 2962, 2038, 983, 1190, 1019, and 297, respectively. Thus, 4-dose-vaccineelicits the lowest neutralization against BA.5;2-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection elicits significantly higher GMTs againstOmicron sublineages than 4-dose-vaccine; and 3-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infectionelicits slightly higher GMTs (statistically insignificant) than the2-dose-vaccine-plus-BA.1-infection. Our results support the inclusion of the BA.5spike for future vaccine booster doses.

TI  - Environmental Stability of Enveloped Viruses is Impacted by the Initial Volumeand Evaporation Kinetics of Droplets.
LID - 2022.07.26.501658 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2022.07.26.501658 [doi]
AB  - Efficient spread of respiratory viruses requires the virus to maintaininfectivity in the environment. Environmental stability of viruses can beinfluenced by many factors, including temperature and humidity. Our studymeasured the impact of initial droplet volume (50, 5, and 1 microL) and relative humidity (RH: 40%, 65%, and 85%) on the stability of influenza A virus,bacteriophage, Phi6, a common surrogate for enveloped viruses, and SARS-CoV-2under a limited set of conditions. Our data suggest that the drying time requiredfor the droplets to reach quasi-equilibrium (i.e. a plateau in mass) varied with RH and initial droplet volume. The macroscale physical characteristics of thedroplets at quasi-equilibrium varied with RH but not with initial droplet volume.We observed more rapid virus decay when the droplets were still wet andundergoing evaporation, and slower decay after the droplets had dried. Initialdroplet volume had a major effect on virus viability over the first few hours;whereby the decay rate of influenza virus was faster in smaller droplets. Ingeneral, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 decayed similarly. Overall, this studysuggests that virus decay in media is closely correlated with the extent ofdroplet evaporation, which is controlled by RH. Taken together, these datasuggest that decay of different viruses is more similar at higher RH and insmaller droplets and is distinct at lower RH and in larger droplets. Importantly,accurate assessment of transmission risk requires use of physiologically relevantdroplet volumes and careful consideration of the use of surrogates. Funding:National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute ofNeurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health; Department ofHealth and Human Services; Flu Lab. Importance: During the COVID-19 pandemic,policy decisions were being driven by virus stability experiments involvingSARS-CoV-2 applied to surfaces in large droplets at various humidity conditions. The results of our study indicate that determination of half-lives for emergingpathogens in large droplets likely over-estimates transmission risk forcontaminated surfaces, as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our studyimplicates the need for the use of physiologically relevant droplet sizes withuse of relevant surrogates in addition to what is already known about theimportance of physiologically relevant media for risk assessment of futureemerging pathogens.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Iranians vaccinated with either AZD1222Vaxzevria, CovIran(R) vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated(lnCoV) or Sputnik V. Methods: We enrolled individuals 18 years or olderreceiving their first COVID-19 vaccine dose between April 2021 and January 2022in seven Iranian cities. Participants completed weekly follow-up surveys for 17weeks (25 weeks for AZD1222) to report their COVID-19 status and hospitalization.We used Cox regression models to assess risk factors for contracting COVID-19,hospitalization and death. Findings: Of 89 783 participants enrolled, incidencerates per 1 000 000 person-days were: 528.2 (95% confidence interval, CI:514.0-542.7) for contracting COVID-19; 55.8 (95% CI: 51.4-60.5) forhospitalization; and 4.1 (95% CI: 3.0-5.5) for death. Compared with SARS-CoV-2Vaccine (Vero Cell), hazard ratios (HR) for contracting COVID-19 were: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61-0.80) with AZD1222; 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62-0.86) with Sputnik V; and 0.73(95% CI: 0.63-0.86) with CovIran(R). For hospitalization and death, all vaccines provided similar protection 14 days after the second dose. History of COVID-19protected against contracting COVID-19 again (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69-0.84).Diabetes and respiratory, cardiac and renal disease were associated with higherrisks of contracting COVID-19 after vaccination. Conclusion: The rates ofcontracting COVID-19 after vaccination were relatively high. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine(Vero Cell) provided lower protection against COVID-19 than other vaccines.People with comorbidities had higher risks of contracting COVID-19 andhospitalization and should be prioritized for preventive interventions.

AB  - Background: There is evidence that fully recovered COVID-19 patients usuallyresume physical exercise, but do not perform at the same intensity levelperformed prior to infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact ofCOVID-19 infection and recovery as well as muscle fatigue on cardiorespiratoryfitness and running biomechanics in female recreational runners. Methods:Twenty-eight females were divided into a group of hospitalized and recoveredCOVID-19 patients (COV, n = 14, at least 14 days following recovery) and a group of healthy age-matched controls (CTR, n = 14). Ground reaction forces fromstepping on a force plate while barefoot overground running at 3.3 m/s wasmeasured before and after a fatiguing protocol. The fatigue protocol consisted ofincrementally increasing running speed until reaching a score of 13 on the 6-20Borg scale, followed by steady-state running until exhaustion. The effects ofgroup and fatigue were assessed for steady-state running duration, steady-staterunning speed, ground contact time, vertical instantaneous loading rate and peak propulsion force. Results: COV runners completed only 56% of the running timeachieved by the CTR (p < 0.0001), and at a 26% slower steady-state running speed (p < 0.0001). There were fatigue-related reductions in loading rate (p = 0.004)without group differences. Increased ground contact time (p = 0.002) and reduced peak propulsion force (p = 0.005) were found for COV when compared to CTR.Conclusion: Our results suggest that female runners who recovered from COVID-19showed compromised running endurance and altered running kinetics in the form of longer stance periods and weaker propulsion forces. More research is needed inthis area using larger sample sizes to confirm our study findings.

AB  - Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is the main threat to cassava (Manihot esculentaCrantz) production in Benin. This study was conducted to assess CMD incidence,disease severity, and adult whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) populations in 11 regionsof Benin. A total of 180 cassava fields across the country were assessed duringJune-December 2020 following the harmonized protocol of the Central and WestAfrican Virus Epidemiology program. Based on symptoms observation, CMD waspresent in all surveyed fields in Oueme and Alibori regions. The highest disease incidence levels were observed in Malanville (100%), Kpomasse (86.67%), Kandi andZagnanado (both 81.67%), Segbanan (80%), and Avrankou (76.67%) districts. Thehighest mean severity scores were in Couffo (3.68), Mono (3.63), and Atlantique(3.33) regions, while the lowest was in Alibori (2.37). Adult whiteflypopulations (mean number/plant) were highest in Couffo (15.88) and Mono (13.00)regions and lowest in Donga (0.06). Significant relationships were found between CMD severity and whitefly abundance (P = 0.0010) but there was no significantrelationship between whitefly numbers and CMD incidence (P = 0.0577). Thesefindings indicate that CMD has expanded its range across Benin. They also providea basis for designing a response strategy for the control of cassava virusdiseases such as CMD.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that infectshumans and can cause birth defects and neurological disorders. Its non-structuralprotein 3 (NS3) contains a protease domain and a helicase domain, both of whichplay essential roles during the viral life cycle. However, it has been shown thatZIKV NS3 has an inherently weak helicase activity, making it unable to unwindlong RNA duplexes alone. How this activity is stimulated to process the viralgenome and whether the two domains of NS3 are functionally coupled remainunclear. Here we used optical tweezers to characterize the RNA unwindingproperties of ZIKV NS3-including its processivity, velocity, and step size-at thesingle-molecule level. We found that external forces that weaken the stability ofthe duplex RNA substrate significantly enhance the helicase activity of ZIKV NS3.On the other hand, we showed that the protease domain increases the bindingaffinity of NS3 to RNA but has only a minor effect on unwinding per se. Ourfindings suggest that the ZIKV NS3 helicase is activated on demand in the contextof viral replication, a paradigm that may be generalizable to other flaviviruses.

AB  - A 68-year-old male patient with lung adenocarcinoma, who was treated withchemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), developed lymphadenopathyduring treatment. His para-aortic lymph nodes increased to 2.0 cm in diameter.Both inguinal lymph nodes were 1.5 cm in diameter, and multiple hepatic massesappeared. After the ICI readministration, both inguinal lymph nodes increased to 2.0 cm in diameter, but the para-aortic lymph nodes and hepatic masses remained. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) diagnosis was established after theright inguinal lymph node biopsy, which was accompanied by an infiltration ofEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small ribonucleic acid-positive B-cells. Afterthe ICI discontinuation, the inguinal lymph nodes decreased to 1.5 cm indiameter, but the para-aortic lymph nodes remained, and hepatic masses increased.Hepatic lesions were possibly lung cancer metastasis. The ICI administration and EBV reactivation were potentially associated with AITL development in the presentcase. The natural shrinkage of lymphoma after the ICI cessation implied theimmunological mechanism like that of the methotrexate-related lymphoproliferativedisease.

TI  - Eukaryotic Microbial RNA Viruses-Acute or Persistent? Insights into TheirFunction in the Aquatic Ecosystem.
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME22034 [doi]
AB  - Isolated RNA viruses mainly parasitize eukaryotes. RNA viruses either expandhorizontally by infecting hosts (acute type) or coexist with the host and arevertically inherited (persistent type). The significance of persistent-type RNAviruses in environmental viromes (the main hosts are expected to be microbes) wasonly recently reported because they had previously been overlooked in virology.In this review, we summarize the host-virus relationships of eukaryotic microbialRNA viruses. Picornavirales and Reoviridae are recognized as representativeacute-type virus families, and most of the microbial viruses in Narnaviridae,Totiviridae, and Partitiviridae are categorized as representative persistent-typeviruses. Acute-type viruses have only been found in aquatic environments, whilepersistent-type viruses are present in various environments, including aquaticenvironments. Moreover, persistent-type viruses are potentially widely spread in the RNA viral sequence space. This emerging evidence provides novel insights intoRNA viral diversity, host-virus relationships, and their history of co-evolution.

TI  - Investigating the effects of population density of residence and rural/urbanclassification on rate of influenza-like illness symptoms in England and Wales.
LID - 10.1111/irv.13032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Better understanding of risk factors for influenza could help improveseasonal and pandemic planning. There is a dearth of literature on area-levelrisk factors such as population density and rural/urban living. METHODS: We used data from Flusurvey, an online community-based cohort that records influenzaevents. The study outcome was symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI).Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to explore associations ofboth population density and rural/urban status with rate of ILI symptoms andwhether these effects differed by vaccination status. RESULTS: Of the 6177 study participants, the median age was 45 (IQR 32-57), 65.73% were female, and 66%reported at least one episode of ILI symptoms between 2011 and 2016. We found no evidence to suggest that the rate of ILI symptoms was higher in the medium [RR1.02 (95% CI 0.95-1.09)] or high [RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.96-1.09)] population density group versus the low population density group. This was the same for the effectof urban living [RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-1.03)] versus rural living on symptom rate.There was weak evidence to suggest that the ILI symptom rate was lower in urbanareas compared with rural areas among unvaccinated individuals only [RR 0.90 (95%CI 0.83-0.99)], whereas no difference was seen among vaccinated individuals [1.04(95% CI 0.94-1.16)]. CONCLUSIONS: Although neither population density norrural/urban status was associated with ILI symptom rate in this community cohort,future research that incorporates activity and contact patterns will help toelucidate this relationship further.

TI  - The impacts of viral infection and subsequent antimicrobials on themicrobiome-resistome of growing pigs.
PG  - 118
LID - 10.1186/s40168-022-01312-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals for purposes ofpreventing, controlling, and/or treating infections. In swine, a major driver of antimicrobial use is porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is caused by a virus that predisposes infected animals to secondary bacterialinfections. Numerous antimicrobial protocols are used to treat PRRS, but we have little insight into how these treatment schemes impact antimicrobial resistance(AMR) dynamics within the fecal microbiome of commercial swine. The aim of thisstudy was to determine whether different PRRS-relevant antimicrobial treatmentprotocols were associated with differences in the fecal microbiome and resistome of growing pigs. To accomplish this, we used a metagenomics approach tocharacterize and compare the longitudinal wean-to-market resistome and microbiomeof pigs challenged with PRRS virus and then exposed to different antimicrobialtreatments, and a group of control pigs not challenged with PRRS virus and havingminimal antimicrobial exposure. Genomic DNA was extracted from pen-levelcomposite fecal samples from each treatment group and subjected to metagenomicsequencing and microbiome-resistome bioinformatic and statistical analysis.Microbiome-resistome profiles were compared over time and between treatmentgroups. RESULTS: Fecal microbiome and resistome compositions both changedsignificantly over time, with a dramatic and stereotypic shift between weaningand 9 days post-weaning (dpw). Antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) richness anddiversity were significantly higher at earlier time points, while microbiomerichness and diversity were significantly lower. The post-weaning shift wascharacterized by transition from a Bacteroides-dominated enterotype toLactobacillus- and Streptococcus-dominated enterotypes. Both the microbiome andresistome stabilized by 44 dpw, at which point the trajectory ofmicrobiome-resistome maturation began to diverge slightly between the treatmentgroups, potentially due to physical clustering of the pigs. Challenge with PRRSvirus seemed to correspond to the re-appearance of many very rare andlow-abundance ARGs within the feces of challenged pigs. Despite very differentantimicrobial exposures after challenge with PRRS virus, resistome compositionremained largely similar between the treatment groups. Differences in ARGabundance between the groups were mostly driven by temporal changes in abundance that occurred prior to antimicrobial exposures, with the exception of ermG, whichincreased in the feces of treated pigs, and was significantly more abundant inthe feces of these pigs compared to the pigs that did not receive post-PRRSantimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The fecal microbiome-resistome of growing pigsexhibited a stereotypic trajectory driven largely by weaning and physiologicaging of the pigs. Events such as viral illness, antimicrobial exposures, andphysical grouping of the pigs exerted significant yet relatively minor influence over this trajectory. Therefore, the AMR profile of market-age pigs is theculmination of the life history of the individual pigs and the populations towhich they belong. Disease status alone may be a significant driver of AMR inmarket-age pigs, and understanding the interaction between disease processes and antimicrobial exposures on the swine microbiome-resistome is crucial todeveloping effective, robust, and reproducible interventions to control AMR.Video Abstract.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a global need to explore thepotential and challenges of online education. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presenceof depression and anxiety in university students and their level of satisfaction with online learning during the period of social isolation caused by the COVID-19pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional design was used to evaluate 152 onlinelearning students from six different university courses: Medicine, Psychology,Law, Engineering, Physiotherapy, and Business. The evaluation of the participantswas carried out through an online survey in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Also, theHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess participants mentalhealth. RESULTS: Most of the participants reported emotional impact, followed by learning impact, financial impact, social impact, and technological impact, with a significant difference in the presence of depressive symptoms, but nosignificant difference in anxiety. The participants presented moderate anxietylevels, with no significant differences between genders, and mild levels ofdepressive symptoms with significant differences between genders. Also, youngerstudents were more anxious than older students. In addition, female students withless social contact presented more depressive symtoms. CONCLUSION: From aclinical perspective, the findings provide insights into mental health amonguniversity students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings may help in the development of effective screening strategies and in the formulation ofinterventions that improve the mental health of students.

TI  - Challenges of Telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.1186/s12911-022-01952-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the decrease of in-person visitsto reduce the risk of virus transmission. Telemedicine is an efficientcommunication tool employed between healthcare providers and patients thatprevents the risk of exposure to infected persons. However, telemedicine use isnot infallible; its users reported multiple issues that complicated the expansionof this technology. So, this systematic review aimed to explore the barriers and challenges of telemedicine use during the pandemic and to propose solutions forimproving future use. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement.PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Embase, andScience Direct were used to look for articles addressing barriers and challenges,in addition to articles proposing solutions. Studies were screened by title andabstract, followed by a full-text review. Risk of bias assessment was done using Critical Appraisal Skills Program for qualitative studies, Newcastle-Ottawa Scalefor cross-sectional studies, and A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews. After the extraction of data, a narrative synthesis andanalysis of the outcomes were performed. RESULTS: Among 1194 papers identified,only 27 studies were included. Barriers and challenges were assembled under 7categories: technical aspects, privacy, data confidentiality and reimbursement,physical examination and diagnostics, special populations, training of healthcareproviders and patients, doctor-patient relationship, and acceptability. Poorinternet connection and lack of universal access to technology were among thetechnical barriers. Concerns about patient privacy and reimbursement hindered theuse of telemedicine too. Physical examination and certain procedures wereimpossible to perform via telemedicine. Training both healthcare providers andpatients was deficient. The doctor-patient relationship was troubled bytelemedicine, and both healthcare providers and patients were reluctant to usetelemedicine. CONCLUSION: Widespread use of telemedicine is still hampered byvarious barriers and challenges. Healthcare providers should work with variousstakeholders to implement the proposed solutions. More research and policychanges are essential to optimize telemedicine utilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lumpy skin disease is a contagious viral disease of cattle caused by LSDV that results in huge economic losses in the cattle industry. This studycharacterizes LSDV in cattle through clinicopathological and molecular techniquesin selected districts of Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: Acrossectional study was conducted from November 2020 to June 2021 using Real-timepolymerase chain reaction and Histopathological techniques to confirm LSDV.RESULT: This study revealed that the percentage of positivity of cattle for LSDV was 36.2%. Clinically, cattle infected with LSDV revealed fever (39-41 degreesC), nodular lesions on the skin and mucous membranes, and lymphadenopathy.Histopathologically, affected tissue revealed ballooning degenerations of theepidermis, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells, vasculitis, andintracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies. RT-PCR confirmed that DNAextracts from skin biopsies of virus isolates were positive for LSDV. CONCLUSION:The present study confirms that LSDV is widely circulating in cattle of selected districts of the Wolaita zone. Thus, effective control measures through regularvaccination and further confirmation of circulating strains of LSDV throughdetailed molecular analysis should be recommended.

In these 6 samples, the mean Cycle threshold (Ct)for CHIKV was 26.87 (SD +/- 10.54) and for MAYV was 29.58 (SD +/- 6.34). Themayaro sequences generated showed 95-100% identity to other Brazilian sequencesof this virus and with other MAYV isolates obtained from human and arthropods in different regions of the world. The remaining samples were detected with CHIKVmonoinfection (41 cases), DENV monoinfection (50 cases) and coinfection betweenCHIKV/DENV (5 cases). We did not detect MAYV monoinfections.

TI  - Home office versus ergonomic workstation - is the ergonomic risk increased whenworking at the dining table? An inertial motion capture based pilot study.
PG  - 745
LID - 10.1186/s12891-022-05704-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to reduce the risk of infection with Sars-Cov-2, workpractices have been shifted to the home office in many industries. The firstsurveys concerning this shift indicate an increase in musculoskeletal complaints of many employees. The aim of this study was to compare the ergonomic risk in theupper extremities and trunk of working in a home office with that of working inan ergonomically optimized workplace. METHODS: For this purpose, 20 subjects(13w/7m) aged 18-31 years each performed a 20-minute workplace simulation (10 minwriting a text, 10 min editing a questionnaire) in the following set up: on adining table with dining chair and laptop (home office) and on an ergonomicallyadjusted workstation (ergonomically optimized workplace). The subjects wereinvestigated using a combined application of a motion capture kinematic analysis and the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) in order to identify differences inthe ergonomic risk. RESULTS: Significantly reduced risk values for both shoulders(left: p < 0.001; right: p = 0.02) were found for the ergonomically optimizedworkstations. In contrast, the left wrist (p = 0.025) showed a significantlyreduced ergonomic risk value for the home office workstation. CONCLUSION: Thisstudy is the first study to compare the ergonomic risk between an ergonomicallyoptimized workplace and a home office workstation. The results indicate minordifferences in the upper extremities in favor of the ergonomically optimizedworkstation. Since work-related musculoskeletal complaints of the upperextremities are common among office workers, the use of an ergonomicallyoptimized workstation for home use is recommended based on the results.

TI  - Virtual screening of Indonesian herbal compounds as COVID-19 supportive therapy: machine learning and pharmacophore modeling approaches.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.1186/s12906-022-03686-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of COVID-19 cases continues to grow in Indonesia. Thisphenomenon motivates researchers to find alternative drugs that function forprevention or treatment. Due to the rich biodiversity of Indonesian medicinalplants, one alternative is to examine the potential of herbal medicines tosupport COVID therapy. This study aims to identify potential compound candidates in Indonesian herbal using a machine learning and pharmacophore modelingapproaches. METHODS: We used three classification methods that had differentdecision-making processes: support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron(MLP), and random forest (RF). For the pharmacophore modeling approach, weperformed a structure-based analysis on the 3D structure of the main proteaseSARS-CoV-2 (3CLPro) and repurposed SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 drugs identifiedfrom the literature as datasets in the ligand-based method. Lastly, we usedmolecular docking to analyze the interactions between the 3CLpro and 14 hitcompounds from the Indonesian Herbal Database (HerbalDB), with lopinavir as apositive control. RESULTS: From the molecular docking analysis, we found sixpotential compounds that may act as the main proteases of the SARS-CoV-2inhibitor: hesperidin, kaempferol-3,4'-di-O-methyl ether (Ermanin);myricetin-3-glucoside, peonidin 3-(4'-arabinosylglucoside); quercetin3-(2G-rhamnosylrutinoside); and rhamnetin 3-mannosyl-(1-2)-alloside. CONCLUSIONS:Our layered virtual screening with machine learning and pharmacophore modelingapproaches provided a more objective and optimal virtual screening and avoidedsubjective decision making of the results. Herbal compounds from the screening,i.e. hesperidin, kaempferol-3,4'-di-O-methyl ether (Ermanin);myricetin-3-glucoside, peonidin 3-(4'-arabinosylglucoside); quercetin3-(2G-rhamnosylrutinoside); and rhamnetin 3-mannosyl-(1-2)-alloside are potentialantiviral candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Moringa oleifera and Psidium guajava thatconsist of those compounds, could be an alternative option as COVID-19 herbalpreventions.

TI  - Identifying novel host-based diagnostic biomarker panels for COVID-19: awhole-blood/nasopharyngeal transcriptome meta-analysis.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.1186/s10020-022-00513-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regardless of improvements in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of comprehensive insight into SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is still asophisticated challenge. In order to deal with this challenge, we utilizedadvanced bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms to reveal morecharacteristics of SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis and introduce novel hostresponse-based diagnostic biomarker panels. METHODS: In the present study, eight published RNA-Seq datasets related to whole-blood (WB) and nasopharyngeal (NP)swab samples of patients with COVID-19, other viral and non-viral acuterespiratory illnesses (ARIs), and healthy controls (HCs) were integrated. Todefine COVID-19 meta-signatures, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyseswere applied to compare COVID-19 with other similar diseases. Additionally,CIBERSORTx was executed in WB samples to detect the immune cell landscape.Furthermore, the optimum WB- and NP-based diagnostic biomarkers were identifiedvia all the combinations of 3 to 9 selected features and the 2-phases machinelearning (ML) method which implemented k-fold cross validation and independenttest set validation. RESULTS: The host gene meta-signatures obtained forSARS-COV-2 infection were different in the WB and NP samples. The gene ontologyand enrichment results of the WB dataset represented the enhancement ininflammatory host response, cell cycle, and interferon signature in COVID-19patients. Furthermore, NP samples of COVID-19 in comparison with HC and non-viralARIs showed the significant upregulation of genes associated with cytokineproduction and defense response to the virus. In contrast, these pathways inCOVID-19 compared to other viral ARIs were strikingly attenuated. Notably, immunecell proportions of WB samples altered in COVID-19 versus HC. Moreover, theoptimum WB- and NP-based diagnostic panels after two phases of ML-basedvalidation included 6 and 8 markers with an accuracy of 97% and 88%,respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the distinct gene expression profiles of WBand NP, our results indicated that SARS-COV-2 function is body-site-specific,although according to the common signature in WB and NP COVID-19 samples versuscontrols, this virus also induces a global and systematic host response to someextent. We also introduced and validated WB- and NP-based diagnostic biomarkersusing ML methods which can be applied as a complementary tool to diagnose theCOVID-19 infection from non-COVID cases.

LID - 10.1007/s11046-022-00653-6 [doi]
AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a systemic mycosis caused by the fungusParacoccidioides spp. is the most prevalent fungal infection amongimmunocompetent patients in Latin America. The estimated frequency of centralnervous system (CNS) involvement among the human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)/PCM-positive population is 2.5%. We aimed to address the impact ofneuroparacoccidioidomycosis (NPCM) and HIV/NPCM co-infection on the tightjunctions (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) proteins of the CNS. Four CNSformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens were studied: NPCM,NPCM/HIV co-infection, HIV-positive without opportunistic CNS infection, andnormal brain autopsy (negative control). Immunohistochemistry was used to analyzethe endothelial cells and astrocytes expressions of TJ markers: claudins(CLDN)-1, -3, -5 and occludin; AJ markers: beta-catenin and E-cadherin; andpericyte marker: alpha-smooth muscle actin. FFPE CNS tissue specimens wereanalyzed using the immunoperoxidase assay. CLDN-5 expression in the capillariesof the HIV/NPCM coinfected tissues (mixed clinical form of PCM) was lower thanthat in the capillaries of the HIV or NPCM monoinfected (chronic clinical form ofPCM) tissues. A marked decrease in CLDN-5 expression and a compensatory increase in CLDN-1 expression in the NPCM/HIV co-infection tissue samples was observed.The authors suggest that Paracoccidioides spp. crosses the blood-brain barrierthrough paracellular pathway, owing to the alteration in the CLDN expression, or inside the macrophages (Trojan horse).

AB  - Globally, cervical cancer, whose etiologic factor is Human papillomavirus (HPV), is the third most common cancer among women. In cervical cancer screening, HPVtesting is important. However, the prevalence of HPV in northern GuangdongProvince has not been conclusively determined. A total of 100,994 women attendingYuebei People's Hospital Affiliated to Shantou University Medical College between2012 and 2020 were recruited. HPV was tested by a polymerase chain reaction(PCR)-based hybridization gene chip assay. The prevalence of HPV among thesewomen was established to be19.04%. Peak prevalence was observed in women aged40-49 (7.29%). Besides, the prevalence of single-type HPV infection (14.46%) was significantly high, compared to multiple-type infection (4.58%) (p < 0.01), whilethe prevalence of high-risk HPV infection (19.97%) was significantly higher than that of low-risk genotypes (5.48%) (p < 0.01). The most prevalent high-riskgenotypes were HPV52 (4.16%), HPV16 (2.98%), HPV58 (2.15%), HPV53 (1.58%) andHPV68 (1.34%). HPV co-infection with up to 10 genotypes was reported for thefirst time. Our findings suggested a high burden of HPV infections among women innorthern Guangdong. Establishing the prevalence and genotype distributioncharacteristics of HPV infections in the region can contribute to cervical cancerprevention through HPV vaccination.

TI  - Recombinant AcMNPV-gp64-EGFP and synergist triphenyl phosphate, an effectivecombination against Spodoptera frugiperda.
LID - 10.1007/s10529-022-03286-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: AcMNPV is a kind of microbial insecticide that can significantlyrelieve the resistance of Spodoptera frugiperda to chemical pesticides. TPP is a widely used synergist, which can reduce the use of pesticides by inhibitingcarboxylesterase. It is emergently needed to develop a biological control way of Spodoptera frugiperda. RESULTS: GP64 mediates low-pH-triggered membrane fusionduring entry by endocytosis and participates in AcMNPV particle budding. Weexplored the synergistic anti-insect activity of AcMNPV-gp64-EGFP and TPP.AcMNPV-gp64-EGFP could increase progeny virus proliferation and accelerate thetranscription of 38k and vp39 genes. TPP could inhibit the carboxylesteraseactivity in the midgut of Spodoptera frugiperda larvae infected withAcMNPV-gp64-EGFP and enhance the virulence of AcMNPV-gp64-EGFP to Spodopterafrugiperda. CONCLUSIONS: TPP targeted carboxylesterase inhibition so thatAcMNPV-gp64-EGFP could escape the antiviral response in insect hosts. It provideda novel strategy for the prevention of Spodoptera frugiperda.

AB  - DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in the geneexpression of all organisms, from viruses to humans, including bacteria andarchaea. The role of these proteins is the fate of gene expression in the contextof environmental challenges. Because thousands of genomes have been sequenced to date, predictions of the encoded proteins are validated through the use ofbioinformatics tools to obtain the necessary experimental, posterior knowledge.In this chapter, we describe three approaches to identify TFs in proteinsequences. The first approach integrates the results of sequence comparisons and PFAM assignments, using as reference a manually curated collection of TFs. Thesecond approach considers the prediction of DNA-binding structures, such as theclassical helix-turn-helix (HTH); and the third approach considers a deeplearning model. We suggest that all approaches must be considered together toincrease the possibility of identifying new TFs in bacterial and archaealgenomes.

TI  - HBV Reactivation After Bariatric Surgery for HBV-Infected Obese Patients.
LID - 10.1007/s11695-022-05979-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease andhepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is inconclusive. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the viral dynamic of HBV and its association with change of body massindex (BMI), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels after bariatric surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent bariatric surgerybetween June 2011 and May 2014 were selected in this retrospective study. BMI,AST, ALT, and HBV DNA levels were calculated pre-operatively and at 1st, 3rd, and6th postoperative months. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-nine patientsincluding 34 (12.2%) HBsAg-positive and 245 (87.8%) HBsAg-negative patients were enrolled. Eighteen HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients were matched with36 HBsAg-negative patients. A significant decrease in BMI was found since 1stpostoperative month in both groups. AST and ALT increased at 1st postoperativemonth, but decreased at 3rd and 6th postoperative months in both groups. However,a significant increase in HBV DNA level was observed in HBeAg-negative patientssince 1st postoperative month with the highest peak at 3rd postoperative month.HBV reactivation occurred in 4 out of 17 (23.5%) patients, 8 out of 16 (50.0%)patients, and 4 out of 12 (33.3%) patients at 1st, 3rd, and 6th postoperativemonths, respectively. The change of HBV DNA was not associated with change ofBMI, AST, or ALT after bariatric surgery. CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery canachieve significant weight loss and improvement of liver function tests. However,there existed significant risk of HBV reactivation after bariatric surgery forpatients with obesity.

TI  - In silico-assisted development of supersaturable preconcentrated isotropicmixture of atazanavir for augmenting biopharmaceutical performance in thepresence of H2-receptor antagonist.
LID - 10.1007/s13346-022-01210-w [doi]
AB  - The therapeutic potential of atazanavir (BCS Class II drug), a highly selectiveinhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), has been largely limited dueto its low intrinsic solubility at elevated pH resulting in low oralbioavailability. Thus, the current work describes the systematic development,optimization, and evaluation of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate(HPMC-AS)-based supersaturable preconcentrate isotropic mixture (SP-IM)containing long-chain triglyceride to improve intestinal lymphatic transport and augment oral bioavailability of atazanavir (ATZ). A D-optimal mixture design was employed for optimization of plain IM containing corn oil, oleic acid, Tween 80, and propylene glycol, evaluating various critical quality attributes (CQAs) like particle size, polydispersity index, self-emulsification time, % transmittance,and drug content. In silico analysis and in vitro supersaturation testfacilitated the selection of HPMC-AS as a best suited polymeric precipitationinhibitor (PPI) for formulating ATZ loaded SP-IM (ATZ-SP-IM). In vitrodissolution data indicated that ATZ-SP-IM exhibits superior performance in 0.025 N HCl and pH 6.8 over pure drug. Ex vivo permeation and in vivo pharmacokineticstudy of ATZ-SP-IM corroborated enhanced permeation (2.03 fold) and improved drugabsorption via lymphatic transport in Wistar rats. Further, the pharmacokineticperformance of ATZ-SP-IM was not affected in presence of H2 receptor antagonist. Therefore, the results showed that ATZ-SP-IM can significantly improve thebiopharmaceutical attributes of ATZ so as to lay a foundation of further researchon the new dosage form of ATZ.

TI  - Prototype mouse models for researching SEND-based mRNA delivery and gene therapy.
LID - 10.1038/s41596-022-00721-7 [doi]
AB  - One of the major challenges of gene therapy-an approach to treat diseases caused by faulty genes-is a lack of technologies that deliver healthy gene copies totarget tissues and cells. Some commonly used approaches include viral vectors or coating therapeutic nucleic acids with lipid-based nanoparticles to pass through cell membranes, but these technologies have had limited success. A revolutionary tool, the CRISPR-Cas gene-editing system, offers tremendous promise, but it toosuffers from problems with delivery. Another tool, called 'SEND' (for 'selective endogenous encapsidation for cellular delivery'), seems to offer a bettersolution. The SEND system uses endogenous genetic components to package mRNAcargoes to deliver them to other cells via virus-like particles (VLPs). TheSEND-VLP tool has enormous potential as a gene-therapy tool, if the endogenouscomponents of SEND can be repurposed to produce VLPs containing therapeuticcargoes. However, several aspects of this newly identified phenomenon are not yetfully understood. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, expressing differentcombinations of SEND components in a controllable and inducible fashion, couldserve as valuable tools to understand more about this tool and to repurpose itfor gene-therapy applications. In this Perspective, we discuss how GEM models andmouse molecular genetics tools could be used for SEND-VLP research.

TI  - Codon-optimized FAM132b gene therapy prevents dietary obesity by blockadingadrenergic response and insulin action.
LID - 10.1038/s41366-022-01189-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: FAM132b (myonectin) has been identified as a muscle-derived myokinewith exercise and has hormone activity in circulation to regulate ironhomeostasis and lipid metabolism via unknown receptors. Here, we aim to explorethe potential of adeno-associated virus to deliver FAM132b in vivo to develop agene therapy against obesity. METHODS: Adeno-associated virus AAV9 wereengineered to induce overexpression of FAM132b with two mutations, A136T andP159A. Then, AAV9 was delivered into high-fat diet mice through tail vein, andglucose homeostasis and obesity development of mice were observed. Methods ofstructural biology were used to predict the action site or receptor of theFAM132b mutant. RESULTS: Treatment of high-fat diet-fed mice with AAV9 improvedglucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and resulted in reductions in bodyweight, fat depot, and adipocyte size. Codon-optimized FAM132b (coFAM132b)reduced the glycemic response to epinephrine (EPI) in the whole body andincreased the lipolytic response to EPI in adipose tissues. However, FAM132bknockdown by shRNA significantly increased the glycemic response to EPI in vivoand reduced adipocyte response to EPI and adipose tissue browning. Structuralanalysis predicted that the FAM132b mutant with A136T and P159A may form a weakbond with beta2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) and may have more affinity forinsulin and insulin-receptor complexes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores thepotential of FAM132b gene therapy with codon optimization to treat obesity bymodulating the adrenergic response and insulin action. Both structural biologicalanalysis and in vivo experiments suggest that the adrenergic response and insulinaction are most likely blockaded by FAM132b mutants.

AB  - Acute respiratory infections are widespread in vulnerable populations of all agesand are characterized by a variety of symptoms. The underlying infection can becaused by a multitude of microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria. Earlydetection of respiratory infections through rapid pathogen screening is vital in averting infectious respiratory disease epidemics. This study utilized amultiplex real-time PCR system to develop a three-tube reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay, enabling simultaneously detect nine respiratory pathogens,including: influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Haemophilus influenzae,Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This technique utilizes aone-step assay, with specifically designed TaqMan primer-probe sets combined inthe same tube. This assay provided rapid and simplified detection of the nineprevalent pathogens, as well as increased sensitivity and reducedcross-contamination. This assay was evaluated using 25 related viral/bacterialstrains as positive references, the other 25 irrelevant strains as negativecontrols, and clinical specimens from 179 patients. All positive strains weredetected with no amplification of the non-target microorganism mixtures and theassay's detection limits ranged between 250-500 copies/ml (1.25-2.5copies/reaction). A total of 167 (93.3%) samples tested positive for at least oneof the pathogens identified; 109 of these samples were from patients confirmed tohave RSV infections. The diagnostic accuracy of our assay was further confirmedby matching results from classical direct immunofluorescence assay and nucleotidesequencing. These data demonstrate the innovative multiplex real-time PCR assayas a promising alternative to the current approaches used for early screening of acute respiratory infections.

AB  - More than one billion people rely on livestock for income, nutrition, and social cohesion, however livestock keeping can facilitate disease transmission andcontribute to climate change. While data on the distribution of livestock havebroad utility across a range of applications, efforts to map the distribution of livestock on a large scale are limited to the Gridded Livestock of the World(GLW) project. We present a complimentary effort to map the distribution ofcattle and pigs in Malawi, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan.In contrast to GLW, which uses dasymmetric modeling applied to census data toproduce time-stratified estimates of livestock counts and spatial density, ourwork uses complex survey data and distinct modeling methods to generate atime-series of livestock distribution, defining livestock density as the ratio ofanimals to humans. In addition to favorable cross-validation results and general agreement with national density estimates derived from external data on national human and livestock populations, our results demonstrate extremely good agreementwith GLW-3 estimates, supporting the validity of both efforts. Our resultsfurthermore offer a high-resolution time series result and employ a definition ofdensity which is particularly well-suited to the study of livestock-originzoonoses.

PG  - 13337
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17573-6 [doi]
AB  - Researchers are focused on discovering compounds that can interfere with theCOVID-19 life cycle. One of the important non-structural proteins isendoribonuclease since it is responsible for processing viral RNA to evadedetection of the host defense system. This work investigates a hierarchicalstructure-based virtual screening approach targeting NSP15. Different filteringapproaches to predict the interactions of the compounds have been included inthis study. Using a deep learning technique, we screened 823,821 compounds fromfive different databases (ZINC15, NCI, Drug Bank, Maybridge, and NCI Diversityset III). Subsequently, two docking protocols (extra precision and induced fit)were used to assess the binding affinity of the compounds, followed by molecular dynamic simulation supported by the MM-GBSA free binding energy. Interestingly,one compound (ZINC000104379474) from the ZINC15 database has been found to have agood binding affinity of - 7.68 kcal/Mol. The VERO-E6 cell line was used toinvestigate its therapeutic effect in vitro. Half-maximal cytotoxic concentrationand Inhibitory concentration 50 were determined to be 0.9 mg/ml and 0.01 mg/ml,respectively; therefore, the selectivity index is 90. In conclusion,ZINC000104379474 was shown to be a good hit for targeting the virus that needsfurther investigations in vivo to be a drug candidate.

LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32208-0 [doi]
AB  - A major goal of current HIV-1 vaccine design efforts is to induce broadlyneutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). The VH1-2-derived bNAb IOMA directed to theCD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is of interest because,unlike the better-known VH1-2-derived VRC01-class bNAbs, it does not require arare short light chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRL3). Here, wedescribe three IOMA-class NAbs, ACS101-103, with up to 37% breadth, that sharemany characteristics with IOMA, including an average-length CDRL3. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that ACS101 shares interactions with those observed withother VH1-2 and VH1-46-class bNAbs, but exhibits a unique binding mode toresidues in loop D. Analysis of longitudinal sequences from the patient suggests that a transmitter/founder-virus lacking the N276 glycan might have initiated thedevelopment of these NAbs. Together these data strengthen the rationale forgermline-targeting vaccination strategies to induce IOMA-class bNAbs and provide a wealth of sequence and structural information to support such strategies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is exacting an increasing toll worldwide, with newSARS-CoV-2 variants emerging that exhibit higher infectivity rates and that maypartially evade vaccine and antibody immunity. Rapid deployment of non-invasivetherapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variantscould complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on theCOVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting theSARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs).We identify an LNA ASO binding to the 5' leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 thatdisrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy inpreventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration ofthis LNA ASO in the COVID-19 mouse model potently suppresses viral replication(>80-fold) in the lungs of infected mice. We find that the LNA ASO is efficaciousin countering all SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" tested both in vitro and invivo. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promisingtherapeutic approach to reduce or prevent transmission and decrease severity ofCOVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can beflexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences and could be stockpiledfor future coronavirus pandemics.

LID - 10.1038/s41420-022-01148-5 [doi]
AB  - RNA polymerase mitochondrial (POLRMT) expression and the potential biologicalfunctions in skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were explored. We showed thatPOLRMT is significantly elevated in skin SCC. Genetic depletion of POLRMT, using shRNA-induced knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO), resulted inprofound anti-skin SCC cell activity. In patient-derived primary skin SCC cellsor immortalized lines (A431 and SCC-9), POLRMT shRNA or KO potently suppressedmitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and suppressed cell viability,proliferation and migration. POLRMT shRNA or KO impaired mitochondrial functions in different skin SCC cells, leading to production of ROS (reactive oxygenspecies), depolarization of mitochondria and depletion of ATP. Moreover,mitochondrial apoptosis cascade was induced in POLRMT-depleted skin SCC cells.IMT1, a POLRMT inhibitor, largely inhibited proliferation and migration, whileinducing depolarization of mitochondria and apoptosis in primary skin SCC cells. Contrarily, ectopic overexpression of POLRMT increased mtDNA transcription andaugmented skin SCC cell growth. Importantly, POLRMT shRNA adeno-associated virus injection robustly hindered growth of the subcutaneous A431 xenografts in mice.In the POLRMT shRNA virus-treated A431 xenograft tissues, POLRMT depletion, mtDNAtranscription inhibition, cell apoptosis, lipid peroxidation and ATP depletionwere detected. Together, overexpressed POLRMT increases mtDNA transcription andpromotes skin SCC growth.

AB  - Rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has led to record-breakingcase incidence rates around the world. Since May 2020, the REal-time Assessmentof Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study tracked the spread of SARS-CoV-2infection in England through RT-PCR of self-administered throat and nose swabsfrom randomly-selected participants aged 5 years and over. In January 2022, wefound an overall weighted prevalence of 4.41% (n = 102,174), three-fold higherthan in November to December 2021; we sequenced 2,374 (99.2%) Omicron infections (19 BA.2), and only 19 (0.79%) Delta, with a growth rate advantage for BA.2compared to BA.1 or BA.1.1. Prevalence was decreasing overall (reproductionnumber R = 0.95, 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.93, 0.97), but increasing inchildren aged 5 to 17 years (R = 1.13, 95% CrI, 1.09, 1.18). In England duringJanuary 2022, we observed unprecedented levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection,especially among children, driven by almost complete replacement of Delta byOmicron.

AB  - Defective interfering genes (DIGs) are short viral genomes and interfere withwild-type viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the new designedSARS-CoV-2 DIG (CD3600) can significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2including Alpha, Delta, Kappa and Omicron variants in human HK-2 cells andinfluenza DIG (PAD4) can significantly inhibit influenza virus replication inhuman A549 cells. One dose of influenza DIGs prophylactically protects 90% micefrom lethal challenge of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and CD3600 inhibits SARS-CoV-2replication in hamster lungs when DIGs are administrated to lungs one day before viral challenge. To further investigate the gene delivery vector in therespiratory tract, a peptidic TAT2-P1&LAH4, which can package genes to form smallspherical nanoparticles with high endosomal escape ability, is demonstrated todramatically increase gene expression in the lung airway. TAT2-P1&LAH4, with the dual-functional TAT2-P1 (gene-delivery and antiviral), can deliver CD3600 tosignificantly inhibit the replication of Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in hamster lungs. This peptide-based nanoparticle system can effectively transfect genes in lungs and deliver DIGs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants and influenza virus invivo, which provides the new insight into the drug delivery system for genetherapy against respiratory viruses.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus and Risk Factors inJiuquan area, China.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28045 [doi]
AB  - The seroprevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is high inXinjiang, China. But the seroprevalence of KSHV and risk factors are stillunknown in Gansu which is adjacent to Xinjiang. 678 serum samples of generalpopulation and 87 serum samples of syphilis patients from Jiuquan, Gansu weretested for antibodies against KSHV including one latent protein (ORF73) and twolytic proteins (ORF65 and K8.1) using the ELISA. The total KSHV-seropositive ratewas 15.9% in 678 serum samples of Jiuquan area, the KSHV-seropositive rate ofmales was higher than females (18.0% VS 14.6%, P > 0.05). The Uygur, Kazakh, Hui,Manchu and Mongolian population had a higher seroprevalence of KSHV than the Han population (43.8%, 40.0%, 34.5%, 30.3%, 35.0% VS 11.0%, respectively) among theethnic groups in Jiuquan. Compared to the Han, Uygur, Kazak, Hui, Manchu andMongolian people had an increase in the risk of KSHV of 528.9%, 439.1%, 325.6%,251.6%, 335.4% (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.003,respectively). The serum prevalence of KSHV in subjects aged < 20 years, 20-50years and > 50 years was 13.8%, 14.7% and 20.1%, respectively. Compared to thesubjects aged < 20 years, 20-50 years and > 50 years had an increase in the risk of KSHV of 7.4% and 56.9% (P = 0.829 and P = 0.204, respectively). Compared tothe positive rate of KSHV in the general population of Anhui, the positive rateof KSHV was significantly higher in the general population of Jiuquan area (15.9%VS 9%, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the positive rate ofKSHV between the Han population of Jiuquan and the Han population of Anhui (P >0.05). In the population of syphilis patients of Jiuquan area, the positive rate of KSHV was 30.7%, which was higher than that of the general population in Gansu area (P < 0.05). This study indicates that Gansu has a high seroprevalence ofKSHV. Ethnicity and syphilis are risk factors for KSHV infection. This article isprotected by copyright. All rights reserved.

PG  - 074101
LID - 10.1063/5.0082222 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we present a surface decontamination system that substitutestraditional chemicals and scrubbing agents, which will be useful for the general public during a pandemic. The technique is based on a hybrid process in whichUV-C light and its photons interact with metal oxide nano-catalysts to generatehydroxyl radicals, which can enhance the deactivation process, and the system canwork even in the shadow regions via a dry process. The optimum number of UV lightsources in combination with TiO2 nanoparticles catalysts on aluminum plates have been used synergistically in the system. The UV dose in the disinfection chamber has been optimized, which is between 60 and 500 mJ/cm(2) throughout thedisinfection chamber. The concentration of hydroxyl radicals is reported morethan 25 000 ions/cm(3) within the disinfection chamber. These ions are circulatedthroughout the disinfection volume. The disinfection efficiency has been testedon bacteria and spores, and the obtained results are correlated. Around 8 logreductions in the counts of the test bacteria of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have been achieved in just 2 min of exposure in the continuousoperation of the system. Tests have also been performed on Geobacillusstearothermophilus spores, and the method described here is the result ofmultiple tests, a review of the scientific literature, and the incorporation ofcurrent laboratory practice. The deactivation tested in the system is larger thanthat of known bacteria and viruses in terms of UV-doses, signifying its utilityduring the pandemic.

AB  - The reported incidence of varicella in Beijing from 2019 to 2021 were 63.8/100000, 32.2/100 000 and 38.6/100 000, respectively. There were two VZV epidemics inBeijing each year, one peaked in May and the other in November. However, thefirst VZV epidemic almost disappeared in 2020. Among the cases involved in thevaricella outbreaks in school, the proportion of the students with no history of vaccine immunization, 1 dose of immunization and 2 doses of immunization were33.12%, 44.79% and 22.08%, respectively. The major body of VZV breakthrough caseswas children aged 6-14 years (523/755, 69.27%). The proportion of moderate- orsevere-rash were 55.32%, 39.06%, 29.96% in the three groups of cases with noimmunization history, 1 dose of immunization and 2 doses of immunization,respectively (P<0.001). A total of 1 089 varicella samples were collected, and837 (76.86%) were confirmed to be PCR-positive for VZV and were identified as VZVwild strains. 311 VZV strains were sequenced successfully, and 307 strains wereclade 2 (98.72%), 1 clade 3 (0.32%) and 3 Clade 5 (0.96%). Compared with therepresentative strains, the nucleotide similarities of ORF22 fragments werebetween 99.4% and 100%, and amino acid similarities were between 99.4% and 100%.

AB  - Objective: To understand the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) andsyphilis and related factors among cross-border couples in Mangshi county, Dehongautonomous prefecture, Yunnan province. Methods: From May, 2017 to April, 2019, 2500 couples with 5 000 cross-border marriages were selected by using clustersampling method. The demographic characteristics, AIDS-related health services,HIV, HCV, syphilis infection and other information were collected throughquestionnaires and laboratory tests. The influencing factors of HIV, HCV andsyphilis infection were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model.Results: A total of 2 500 couples with cross-border marriage were investigated,among which 2 438 (97.5%) couples were Chinese men with Myanmar women. Theaverage age of 5 000 participants was (34.16+/-9.00) years. Most of them wereminority groups (59.9%), farmers (98.5%), education years </=6 years (81.4%),marriage years>3 years (80.0%), and from mountainous areas (61.7%). The HIVprevalence of Chinese and Myanmar populations was 1.7% (43/2 500) and 2.0% (49/2 500), respectively. The HCV infection rates were 2.0% (49/2 500) and 1.3% (32/2500), respectively and the infection rates of syphilis were 0.4% (10/2 500) and0.2% (4/2 500), respectively. There were no statistically significant differencesin the prevalence of three diseases among Chinese and Myanmar populations(P>0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that compared with those aged </= 30years, having lower AIDS awareness, never receiving HIV testing, without HCV and syphilis infection, HIV prevalence was higher among those aged>30 years (OR=3.21,95%CI: 1.80-5.73), having higher AIDS awareness (OR=17.41, 95%CI: 4.27-70.91),receiving HIV testing (OR=4.93, 95%CI: 2.72-8.92), with HCV infection (OR=5.64,95%CI: 2.72-11.70) and syphilis infection (OR=8.37, 95%CI: 1.63-43.08). Compared with those aged </= 30 years, having marriage years </= 3 years, and with HIVnegatives, HCV infection rate was higher among those age>30 years (OR=3.02,95%CI: 1.69-5.38), having marriage years>3 years (OR=2.24, 95%CI: 1.34-3.74), andwith HIV positives (OR=6.69, 95%CI: 3.29-13.59). Compared with those having HIVnegatives, the syphilis infection rate was relatively higher among participantswith HIV positives (OR=9.07, 95%CI: 2.00-41.10). Conclusion: The prevalence ofHIV, HCV, and syphilis among cross-border couples in Mangshi county, Dehongautonomous prefecture of Yunnan province is relatively high. Age, AIDS awareness,HIV testing history, and the length of marriage are associated with the HIV, HCV,and syphilis infection.

AB  - Objective: To determine IgG antibody levels of measles, rubella, mumps in healthypopulation in Shanghai from 2010 to 2020 and analyze the trend of antibodychanges in different age groups. Methods: 10 828 healthy people without measles, rubella and mumps in Shanghai were included in the study from 2010 to 2020. Serumsamples were collected from 12 age groups, and the serum IgG antibody of measles,rubella and mumps were detected by ELISA. The difference of antibody positiverates and antibody levels were analyzed. Results: The median age M (Q1, Q3) of 10828 objects were 8 years old (9 months old, 20 years old). Males accounted for48.34% (5 234/10 828) and females accounted for 50.92% (5 514/10 828). Unknowngender information accounted for 0.74% (80/10 828), and 27.03% (2 927/10 828) of participants had unknown MMR immunization history. The total positive rates ofmeasles, rubella and mumps IgG antibody were 76.78%, 64.46% and 64.29% and their GMCs were 541.45 mIU/ml, 31.76 IU/ml and 133.73 U/ml respectively. There weresignificant differences in serum IgG antibody GMC of measles, rubella and mumpsin each year (Fmeasles=180.74, P<0.001; Frubella=189.95, P<0.001; Fmumps=122.40, P<0.001). The positive rate of measles antibody was higher than that of rubellaand mumps, and the difference was statistically significant (chi(2)=518.09,P<0.001). Conclusion: The level of measles IgG antibody in healthy people inShanghai is higher, while the level of rubella and mumps IgG antibody is slightlylower.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the genetic characteristics of varicella zoster virus(VZV) in Shandong province from 2020 to 2021. Methods: From April 2020 toDecember 2021, 85 herpes fluid samples from suspected varicella patients inShandong province were collected. The qPCR was used to detect viral DNA andscreen suspected samples. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ORF22fragment and ORF38 fragment in positive samples were examined via PCR and Sanger sequencing to identify the viral genotypes. Four SNPs of ORF38 and ORF62 wereexamined to identify the vaccine and wild-type strains. The sequences wereanalyzed with Sequencher and MEGA7 software, using the VZV reference strainsequences from GenBank. Results: In the 85 samples suspected of varicella, 80were VZV positive and wild-type strains belonging to Clade 2. Compared with clade2 representative strains, the nucleotide and amino acid similarities of ORF22fragment were 99.5%-100% and 98.5%-100%, respectively. SD20-1, SD20-5, SD20-6,SD20-8, SD20-9, SD20-10, SD20-11, SD20-12, SD20-13, SD20-30 and SD20-31 had a AG nucleotide mutation at 37990, causing amino acid change from glutamine toarginine. SD21-1 had a CA nucleotide mutation at 38059, causing threonine toasparagine during coding. Conclusions: From 2020 to 2021, all VZV strains inShandong province are the wild-type strains belonging to Clade 2.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is rampant in Europe and the United States, andthe Delta variant has caused several small-scale outbreaks in China. It isparticularly important to simulate the transmission risk of novel coronaviruspneumonia (COVID-19) during large-scale events, so as to ensure a goodpreparation of personnel, materials, isolation sites and other support work inadvance. Taking the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games as an example, this studyintroduces the use of mathematical models to simulate the entry risks,closed-loop risks and prevention and control measures of athletes, officials and other stakeholders of the Olympic Games. In the simulation results on January 19,2022, the estimated number of Olympic Games-related infections who wereidentified at borders was 357 (95%CI: 153-568) and the observed number was 323.The estimated number of "seed" cases that entered the closed-loop of OlympicsGames was 195 (95%CI: 43-335), and the observed number of cases in theclosed-loop was 212. This study demonstrates the important role of mathematicalmodels of infectious diseases in the pragmatic application of preventive medicineand public health.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the application value of Metagenomic Next-Generationsequencing (mNGS) in infectious patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem celltransplantation(allo-HSCT). Methods: Patients suspected with local or systemicinfections were retrospectively included after allo-HSCT in our department fromApril 2019 to November 2020. Pathogenic microorganisms were tested by mNGS insamples from peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, alveolar lavage Liquid,abscess, etc. Other diagnostic methods such as bacterial/fungal culture, viralPCR detection were simultaneously explored comparing with mNGS results. Results: A total of 112 samples in 83 patients were detected by mNGS, and 34 pathogenicmicroorganisms were determined. Among these positive samples, 11 strains ofbacteria (17 times) with the most common Escherichia coli (4/17) were reported.There were 7 strains of fungi (10 times) detected with primary Candida albicans(7/29). Although arvovirus 30.2% (39/129) were predominantly detected, itsdiagnostic relevance with infections was not definite. Other pathogenic virusesincluding cytomegalovirus (CMV) 25.6% (33/129) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) 14.0%(18/129)were of significance. Comparing with golden diagnostic criteria, thesensitivity of mNGS was 86.5%, and specificity was 45.0%. Regarding singlepathogen infection, the consistency of mNGS and conventional methods was 82.9%(29/35), while it was 16/17 in combination infections. Conclusion: mNGS could be a potential method to determine pathogens in patients suspected with infectionsafter allo-HSCT.

AB  - Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using availableresources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity ofCOVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of naturalproduct use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity andhospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan.Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were >/=18 years old were the studypopulation. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was usedfor statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean +/- SD) of the study sample(n=2,148) was 40.25 +/- 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37-0.85]), onion (OR[0.69], CI [0.52-0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51-0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR[0.66], CI [0.50-0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantialreduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR[0.55], CI [0.34-0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42-0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR[0.61], CI [0.44-0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in thefrequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regularconsumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection wasassociated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations arerequired to confirm these findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the working environment, how wethink of it and how it stands to develop into the future. Knowledge about howpeople have continued to work on-site and adjusted to working from home duringthe COVID-19 lockdown will be vital for planning work arrangements in thepost-pandemic period. Our primary objective was to investigate experiences ofworking from home or having colleagues working from home during a late stage ofthe COVID-19 lockdown among researchers and healthcare providers in a hospitalresearch setting. Second, we aimed to investigate researchers' productivitythrough changes in various proxy measures during lockdown as compared withpre-lockdown. DESIGN: Mixed-method participatory Group Concept Mapping (GCM).SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: GCM, based on a mixed-method participatory approach,was applied involving researchers' and healthcare providers' online sorting andrating experiences working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. At aface-to-face meeting, participants achieved consensus on the number and labellingof domains-the basis for developing a conceptual model. RESULTS: Through the GCM approach, 47 participants generated 125 unique statements of experiences related to working from home, which were organised into seven clusters. Using theseclusters, we developed a conceptual model that illustrated the pros and cons ofworking from home. CONCLUSION: The future work setting, the role of the officeand the overall work environment need to respond to workers' increased wish forflexible work arrangements and co-decision.

PG  - e059111
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identifying patients with a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in theemergency department (ED) is challenging. Symptoms differ, incidence rates varyand test capacity may be limited. As PCR-testing all ED patients is neitherfeasible nor effective in most centres, a rapid, objective, low-cost earlywarning score to triage ED patients for a possible infection is developed.DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary hospitals in theNetherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients presenting to the ED with venous blood sampling from July 2019 to July 2020 (n=10 417, 279SARS-CoV-2-positive). The temporal validation cohort covered the period from July2020 to October 2021 (n=14 080, 1093 SARS-CoV-2-positive). The externalvalidation cohort consisted of patients presenting to the ED of three hospitalsin the Netherlands (n=12 061, 652 SARS-CoV-2-positive). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary outcome was one or more positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results within 1day prior to or 1 week after ED presentation. RESULTS: The resulting'CoLab-score' consists of 10 routine laboratory measurements and age. The scoreshowed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.930, 95% CI 0.909 to 0.945). Thelowest CoLab-score had high sensitivity for COVID-19 (0.984, 95% CI 0.970 to0.991; specificity: 0.411, 95% CI 0.285 to 0.520). Conversely, the highest score had high specificity (0.978, 95% CI 0.973 to 0.983; sensitivity: 0.608, 95% CI0.522 to 0.685). The results were confirmed in temporal and external validation. CONCLUSIONS: The CoLab-score is based on routine laboratory measurements and isavailable within 1 hour after presentation. Depending on the prevalence, COVID-19may be safely ruled out in over one-third of ED presentations. Highly suspectcases can be identified regardless of presenting symptoms. The CoLab-score iscontinuous, in contrast to the binary outcome of lateral flow testing, and canguide PCR testing and triage ED patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) booster dosesduring the period of Delta and Omicron variant dominance. DESIGN: We conducted a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the vaccine effectiveness(VE) of three and two doses of mRNA vaccines against infection (regardless ofsymptoms) and against COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death. SETTING:Veterans Health Administration. PARTICIPANTS: We used electronic health recorddata from 114 640 veterans who had a SARS-CoV-2 test during November 2021-January2022. Patients were largely 65 years or older (52%), male (88%) and non-Hispanic white (59%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First positive result for a SARS-CoV-2 PCR orantigen test. RESULTS: Against infection, booster doses had higher estimated VE(64%, 95% CI 63 to 65) than two-dose vaccination (12%, 95% CI 10 to 15) duringthe Omicron period. For the Delta period, the VE against infection was 90% (95%CI 88 to 92) among boosted vaccinees, higher than the VE among two-dose vaccinees(54%, 95% CI 50 to 57). Against hospitalisation, booster dose VE was 89% (95% CI 88 to 91) during Omicron and 94% (95% CI 90 to 96) during Delta; two-dose VE was 63% (95% CI 58 to 67) during Omicron and 75% (95% CI 69 to 80) during Delta.Against death, the VE with a booster dose was 94% (95% CI 90 to 96) duringOmicron and 96% (95% CI 87 to 99) during Delta. CONCLUSIONS: Among an older,mostly male, population with comorbidities, we found that an mRNA vaccine boosterwas highly effective against infection, hospitalisation and death. Although theeffectiveness of booster vaccination against infection was moderately higheragainst Delta than against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant, effectiveness against severe disease and death was similarly high against both variants.

TI  - Role of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on HPV infection and recurrence ofHPV related disease after local surgical treatment: systematic review andmeta-analysis.
PG  - e070135
LID - 10.1136/bmj-2022-070135 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination onthe risk of HPV infection and recurrent diseases related to HPV infection inindividuals undergoing local surgical treatment. DESIGN: Systematic review andmeta-analysis DATA SOURCES: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science,and ClinicalTrials.gov were screened from inception to 31 March 2021. REVIEWMETHODS: Studies reporting on the risk of HPV infection and recurrence of diseaserelated to HPV infection after local surgical treatment of preinvasive genitaldisease in individuals who were vaccinated were included. The primary outcomemeasure was risk of recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 orhigher (CIN2+) after local surgical treatment, with follow-up as reported byindividual studies. Secondary outcome measures were risk of HPV infection orother lesions related to HPV infection. Independent and in duplicate dataextraction and quality assessment were performed with ROBINS-I and RoB-2 toolsfor observational studies and randomised controlled trials, respectively. Gradingof Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) wasimplemented for the primary outcome. Observational studies and randomisedcontrolled trials were analysed separately from post hoc analyses of randomisedcontrolled trials. Pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals werecalculated with a random effects meta-analysis model. The restricted maximumlikelihood was used as an estimator for heterogeneity, and theHartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method was used to derive confidence intervals.RESULTS: 22 articles met the inclusion criteria of the review; 18 of thesestudies also reported data from a non-vaccinated group and were included in themeta-analyses (12 observational studies, two randomised controlled trials, andfour post hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials). The risk of recurrenceof CIN2+ was reduced in individuals who were vaccinated compared with those whowere not vaccinated (11 studies, 19 909 participants; risk ratio 0.43, 95%confidence interval 0.30 to 0.60; I(2)=58%, tau(2)=0.14, median follow-up 36months, interquartile range 24-43.5). The effect estimate was even stronger when the risk of recurrence of CIN2+ was assessed for disease related to HPV subtypes HPV16 or HPV18 (six studies, 1879 participants; risk ratio 0.26, 95% confidenceinterval 0.16 to 0.43; I(2)=0%, tau(2)=0). Confidence in the meta-analysis forCIN2+ overall and CIN2+ related to HPV16 or HPV18, assessed by GRADE, ranged fromvery low to moderate, probably because of publication bias and inconsistency inthe studies included in the meta-analysis. The risk of recurrence of CIN3 wasalso reduced in patients who were vaccinated but uncertainty was large (threestudies, 17 757 participants; 0.28, 0.01 to 6.37; I(2)=71%, tau(2)=1.23).Evidence of benefit was lacking for recurrence of vulvar, vaginal, and analintraepithelial neoplasia, genital warts, and persistent and incident HPVinfections, although the number of studies and participants in each outcome waslow. CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination might reduce the risk of recurrence of CIN, inparticular when related to HPV16 or HPV18, in women treated with local excision. GRADE assessment for the quality of evidence indicated that the data wereinconclusive. Large scale, high quality randomised controlled trials are requiredto establish the level of effectiveness and cost of HPV vaccination in womenundergoing treatment for diseases related to HPV infection.

TI  - Coronaviruses exploit a host cysteine-aspartic protease for replication.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05148-4 [doi]
AB  - Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1,2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)(3), and SARS-CoV-1(4) vary in their transmissibility andpathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantialapoptosis in cell culture(5-7) and in patient tissues(8-10), suggesting apotential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstratethat caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating Nfragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virusreplication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves thesurvival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoVMA)-infected human DPP4 knock-in(hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a componentof the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication.

AB  - The pulmonary pathological findings associated with severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) result from the release of multipleproinflammatory cytokines, which causes the subsequential damage of the lungs.The current study was undertaken to investigate the responses of mast cells toviral inoculation and their contribution to host defenses from the point of view of viral entry. Pseudovirions, in which the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was incorporated, triggered activation of mast cells, and a mast cell-derivedchymase, MCP2, formed a complex with spike protein, which promotedprotease-dependent viral entry. According to the quantification results of viral entry, 10muM quercetin, a mast cell stabilizer, potentially potently inhibited41.3% of viral entry, while 100muM chymostatin, which served as a chymaseinhibitor, suppressed 52.1% of viral entry, compared to non-treated cells. Study using mast cell-deficient mice showed that the absence of mast cells mayinfluence early viral loading in the upper respiratory tract, which consequently increases the risk of viral invasion into the lower respiratory system.Furthermore, mast cell-deficient mice exhibited ongoing infection in the latephase post-viral inoculation, while clearance of virus-positive cells wasobserved in wild-type mice. In conclusion, mast cells act as a multifacetedimmune modulator that is equipped with both protective effects and pathogenicinfluences on viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. The utility of mast cell stabilizers andchymase inhibitors in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratorysyndrome should be optimized regarding the infection stage and the risk ofcytokine storm.

AB  - Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a baculovirus that infects silkworms,and its interaction with silkworm has been considered an important model in thefield of insect virology. Accumulating evidence indicates that most virusespromote glycolytic metabolism in host cells to favor infection. However, similar reports are lacking in insects, especially in the area of post-translationalmodifications of proteins. In this study, we found that BmNPV infection inducedthe acetylation of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO) on lysine 42 (K42) topromote its enzyme activity. To explore the underlying mechanisms, site-directed mutagenesis of deacetylated mimic (K/R) was performed. The results demonstratedthat K42 acetylation promoted viral proliferation by exacerbating the glycolytic flux induced by BmNPV infection, which resulted in increased ATP, glucose uptake and lactate accumulation. Inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxygucose (2DG) revealedthat glycolysis was essential for optimal BmNPV infection. Finally, we showedthat BmNPV-infected cells enhanced the transcription of glycolysis-related genes,including Glut1, Hk2 and Ldh. In parallel, K42 acetylation of ALDO also promoted the expression of these genes. Therefore, acetylation of ALDO could be considereda regulator of BmNPV-induced glycolysis. These finding provide insights into the interaction between silkworm and BmNPV.

AB  - Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosisvirus (RGNNV) are important pathogens that cause high mortality and heavyeconomic losses in grouper aquaculture. Interestingly, SGIV infection in grouper cells induces paraptosis-like cell death, while RGNNV infection induces autophagyand necrosis characterized morphologically by vacuolation of lysosome. Here, acomparative transcriptomic analysis was carried out to identify the differentmolecular events during SGIV and RGNNV infection in grouper spleen (EAGS) cells. The functional enrichment analysis of DEGs suggested that several signalingpathways were involved in CPE progression and host immune response against SGIVor RGNNV. Most of DEGs featured in the KEGG "lysosome pathway" were up-regulated in RGNNV-infected cells, indicating that RGNNV induced lysosomal vacuolizationand autophagy might be due to the disturbance of lysosomal function. More than100 DEGs in cytoskeleton pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)signal pathway were identified during SGIV infection, providing additionalevidence for the roles of cytoskeleton remodeling in cell rounding during CPEprogression and MAPK signaling in SGIV induced cell death. Of note, consistentwith changes at the transcriptional levels, the post-translational modifications of MAPK signaling-related proteins were also detected during RGNNV infection, andthe inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPKsignificantly suppressed viral replication and virus induced vacuoles formation. Moreover, the majority of DEGs in interferon and inflammation signaling wereobviously up-regulated during RGNNV infection, but down-regulated during SGIVinfection, suggesting that SGIV and RGNNV differently manipulated host immuneresponse in vitro. In addition, purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways werealso differently regulated in SGIV and RGNNV-infection cells. Taken together, ourdata will provide new insights into understanding the potential mechanismsunderlying different host cell responses against fish DNA and RNA virus.

AB  - Autophagy impacts the replication cycle of many viruses. Grass Carp Reovirus(GCRV) is an agent that seriously affects the development of the grass carpaquaculture industry. The role of autophagy in GCRV infection is not clearlyunderstood. In this study, we identified that GCRV infection triggered autophagy in CIK cells, which was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, theconversion of LC3B I to LC3B II and the level of autophagy substrate p62.Furthermore, we found that GCRV infection activated Akt-mTOR signaling pathway,and the conversion of LC3B I to LC3B II was increased by inhibiting mTOR withrapamycin (Rap) but decreased by activating Akt with insulin. We then assessedthe effects of autophagy on GCRV replication. We found that inducing autophagywith Rap promoted GCRV proliferation but inhibiting autophagy with 3MA or CQinhibited GCRV replication in CIK cells. Moreover, it was found that enhancingAkt-mTOR activity by insulin, GCRV VP7 protein and viral titers of GCRV weredecreased. Collectively, these results indicated that GCRV infection inducedautophagy involved in GCRV replication via the Akt-mTOR signal pathway. Thus, newinsights into GCRV pathogenesis and antiviral treatment strategies are provided.

AB  - Proteins of Spatzle family play an essential role in innate immunity ininvertebrates by activating the Toll pathway to induce the expression ofantimicrobial peptides. However, little is known about the function of Spatzle inin the immune response of the Chinese mitten crab. In the present study, threenovel Spatzle genes (named as EsSpz1, EsSpz2, and EsSpz3) were identified fromEriocheir sinensis. The genome structure of EsSpz1 contains two exons and anintron. Three Spatzle proteins all contain a Pfam Spaetzle domain. In theevolution, EsSpz1-3 cluster with other Spatzle proteins from crustaceans.EsSpz1-3 were widely distributed in multiple immune tissues. The expressionlevels of EsSpz1-3 in the intestine were remarkably upregulated after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. The knockdown of EsSpz1-3 remarkably decreasedthe expressions of crustins and anti-lipopolysaccharide factors during WSSVinfection. Moreover, EsSpz1-3 silencing remarkably increased the expression ofWSSV envelope protein VP28. These findings suggest that new-found EsSpz1-3 in E. sinensis could promote the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and inhibit theexpression of VP28 during WSSV infection. Our study indicates that EsSpz1-3 in E.sinensis may participate in the innate immune defenses against WSSV by inducingthe expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study provides new knowledge forthe function of Spatzle in the antiviral immune defense in crustacean.

AB  - Mosquitoes are a vector of human disease transmitting malaria, and manyarboviruses such as dengue virus and Zika virus. This study determined mosquitolarval occurrence and abundance in residential areas around Suratthani RajabhatUniversity as influenced by ecological factors and breeding container diversity. Mosquito larvae were collected using a standard dipping method from 95 locations during April through September 2019 and environmental factors such asphysicochemical parameters of water in the breeding containers were measured.During the survey, a total of 194 houses were inspected, of which 58 were foundto be infested with mosquito larvae, with a house index of 29.90, a containerindex of 25.55, and a Breteau index of 48.99. A total of 5,123 mosquito larvaewere reported from seven breeding habitat types namely, plastics, cement, mudpots, glass, foam, discarded tires and natural materials. Among the collectedlarvae, Aedes albopictus (56.45%) was most prevalent, while Culex sp. (22.33%)and Aedes aegypti were less prevalent (21.21%). The most common mosquito larvaebreeding habitats were plastics (44.22%) followed by discarded tires (18.14%).The spearman correlation analysis showed that the number of mosquito larvae were significantly positively correlated with the depths and width of containers(p<0.05). These findings are helpful in understanding the ecological factors and breeding habitat types that influence mosquito species and their abundance, andalso in determining ways to control mosquito borne diseases.

AB  - Capsid assembly modulators (CAMs) have recently been revealed to be effective in blocking HBV replication. HBV capsid protein inhibitors reduce and ultimatelyeliminate HBV by inhibiting virus replication and blocking hepatocyte infection. Sulfonamides are synthetic functional groups in development of different kinds ofdrugs. Sulfonyl benzamide clinical drugs NVR 3-778 and BA-38017 are leadcompounds in discovery of antiviral compounds with increased activity and reducedcytotoxicity by drug design strategies including pharmacophore hybrid,bioisosterism and scaffold hopping. In current study, three series of targetcompounds were synthesized, and their anti-HBV activity was evaluated againstHepAD38 cells. Compound 5a (EC50 = 0.50 +/- 0.07 muM, CC50 = 48.16 +/- 9.15 muM) showed better anti-HBV DNA replication activity than the lead compound BA-38017, and showed good inhibitory effect on the assembly of HBV capsid protein compared with the clinical drug NVR 3-778. In addition, preliminary structure-activityrelationship (SAR) and molecular docking studies were conducted to explorepotential interactions and binding modes between compounds and target proteins,which may help researchers to find more effective anti-HBV drugs.

AB  - Targeting the vital kinase protein TBK1, optineurin (OPTN) performs as asuppressor involved in controlling RNA virus-induced interferon beta (IFN-beta)production. It has been determined that OPTN is altered by phosphorylation andubiquitination, which are crucial for the generation of IFN-beta and mitophagy.In this study, endogenous OPTN was first discovered in human cells at a molecularmass of about 115 kD. The SUMOylation band was verified to be the highermolecular mass band of the OPTN. Additionally, the OPTN SUMOylation band was seenin cells from several species, including mouse, rabbit, bovine, porcine, etc.,but not in cells from avian animals (chicken and duck). This finding suggeststhat OPTN SUMOylation is well conserved in mammals but not in avian animals.Additionally, it was determined that some lysine residues in the human OPTN hadSUMOylation sites that followed the consensus motif. LPS, VSV infection,starvation, and RNA virus infection are a few of the stimuli that encourageendogens OPTN SUMOylation. OPTN SUMOylation is essential for OPTN biologicalactivity, as evidenced by the stark differences in the cellular distribution ofmutant OPTN SUMOylation sites from wild type (WT) OPTN. Additionally, wediscovered that non-SUMOylated OPTN lost its ability to block both IFN-betaproduction. Our findings offer a preliminary understanding of how OPTNSUMOylation regulates IFN-beta production.

AB  - Velpatasvir is a novel inhibitor of hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5Athat received US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment ofpatients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1-6. In the present study, asensitive bioanalytical method for velpatasvir was developed usinghigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detectorsystem, which was applied to elucidate the factors determining the oralbioavailability and disposition of velpatasvir. This method offered sufficientsensitivity, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL, which iscomparable to previously reported methods using liquid chromatography coupledwith tandem mass spectrometry. Velpatasvir exhibited low oral bioavailability,moderate intestinal permeability, and significant biliary excretion in rats. Itwas also found to be significantly metabolized in the liver, with alow-to-moderate extraction ratio; however, its intestinal metabolism andenterohepatic circulation did not occur. Thus, our present results demonstratethat the oral bioavailability of velpatasvir is primarily dependent on gutabsorption and hepatic first-pass metabolism. The fractions of velpatasvir doseunabsorbed from the gut and eliminated by the liver before reaching the systemic circulation following oral administration were estimated to be 32.8%-58.6% and4.74%-30.54% of the oral dose, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to investigate the contributory roles of biopharmaceutical andpharmacokinetic factors on the oral bioavailability of velpatasvir, together witha new bioanalytical method for velpatasvir.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agentof the disease COVID-19, first emerged in late December 2019 in China, and hassubsequently become a pandemic with unprecedented clinical impact. The virusappears to more severely affect older individuals and those with co-morbidmedical conditions, specifically those with chronic lung disease, obesity, heart failure and diabetes. Fortunately, children appear to be less severely affected, though mortality and severe disease have been reported. In addition, children'srole in spreading the disease (potentially through asymptomatic shedding of thevirus) remains an important area requiring further investigation. The emergenceof SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the importance of metagenomic next generationsequencing as a tool for pandemic investigation. Though no proven therapeuticoptions currently exist, ongoing genomic and clinical trial data may help inform the identification and development of both repurposed and novel therapeuticagents for use in this disease.

LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c03119 [doi]
AB  - The elucidation of viral-receptor interactions and an understanding ofvirus-spreading mechanisms are of great importance, particularly in the era of a pandemic. Indeed, advances in computational chemistry, synthetic biology, andprotein engineering have allowed precise prediction and characterization of such interactions. Nevertheless, the hazards of the infectiousness of viruses, theirrapid mutagenesis, and the need to study viral-receptor interactions in a complexin vivo setup call for further developments. Here, we show the development ofbiocompatible genetically engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) that displaythe receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on their surface as coronavirusmimetics (EVs(RBD)). Loading EVs(RBD) with iron oxide nanoparticles makes themMRI-visible and, thus, allows mapping of the binding of RBD to ACE2 receptorsnoninvasively in live subjects. Moreover, we show that EVs(RBD) can be modifiedto display mutants of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, allowing rapid screening ofcurrently raised or predicted variants of the virus. The proposed platform thusshows relevance and cruciality in the examination of quickly evolving pathogenic viruses in an adjustable, fast, and safe manner. Relying on MRI forvisualization, the presented approach could be considered in the future to mapligand-receptor binding events in deep tissues, which are not accessible toluminescence-based imaging.

PG  - e2123362119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2123362119 [doi]
AB  - The germinal center (GC) plays a central role in the generation ofantigen-specific B cells and antibodies. Tight regulation of the GC is essential due to the inherent risks of tumorigenesis and autoimmunity posed byinappropriate GC B cell processes. Gammaherpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) utilize numerous armaments to drive infected naive B cells, independent of antigen, through GC reactions to expandthe latently infected B cell population and establish a stable latency reservoir.We previously demonstrated that the MHV68 microRNA (miRNA) mghv-miR-M1-7-5prepresses host EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) to promote B cellinfection. EWSR1 is a transcription and splicing regulator that is recognized forits involvement as a fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma. A function for EWSR1 in Bcell responses has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that 1) Bcell-specific deletion of EWSR1 had no effect on generation of mature B cellsubsets or basal immunoglobulin levels in naive mice, 2) repression or ablationof EWSR1 in B cells promoted expansion of MHV68 latently infected GC B cells, and3) B cell-specific deletion of EWSR1 during a normal immune response to nonviral antigen resulted in significantly elevated numbers of antigen-specific GC Bcells, plasma cells, and circulating antibodies. Notably, EWSR1 deficiency didnot affect the proliferation or survival of GC B cells but instead resulted inthe generation of increased numbers of precursor GC B cells. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that EWSR1 is a negative regulator of B cell responses.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) induces strong antibody (Ab) and T cellresponses. Although considered to be localized in the cytosol, we readily detect N on the surface of live cells. N released by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells orN-expressing transfected cells binds to neighboring cells by electrostatichigh-affinity binding to heparan sulfate and heparin, but not other sulfatedglycosaminoglycans. N binds with high affinity to 11 human chemokines, including CXCL12beta, whose chemotaxis of leukocytes is inhibited by N from SARS-CoV-2,SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV. Anti-N Abs bound to the surface of N-expressing cellsactivate Fc receptor-expressing cells. Our findings indicate that cell surface N manipulates innate immunity by sequestering chemokines and can be targeted byFc-expressing innate immune cells. This, in combination with its conservedantigenicity among human CoVs, advances its candidacy for vaccines that inducecross-reactive B and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human CoVs,including novel zoonotic strains.

PG  - e0010305
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The simultaneous infection of Plasmodium falciparum and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) could promote the development of the aggressive endemic Burkitt'sLymphoma (eBL) in children living in P. falciparum holoendemic areas. While it iswell-established that eBL is not related to other human malaria parasites, theimpact of EBV infection on the generation of human malaria immunity remainslargely unexplored. Considering that this highly prevalent herpesvirusestablishes a lifelong persistent infection on B-cells with possible influence onmalaria immunity, we hypothesized that EBV co-infection could have impact on the naturally acquired antibody responses to P. vivax, the most widespread humanmalaria parasite. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study design involved threecross-sectional surveys at six-month intervals (baseline, 6 and 12 months) among long-term P. vivax exposed individuals living in the Amazon rainforest. Theapproach focused on a group of malaria-exposed individuals whose EBV-DNA(amplification of balf-5 gene) was persistently detected in the peripheral blood (PersVDNA, n = 27), and an age-matched malaria-exposed group whose EBV-DNA could never be detected during the follow-up (NegVDNA, n = 29). During the follow-upperiod, the serological detection of EBV antibodies to lytic/ latent viralantigens showed that IgG antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA-p18) weresignificantly different between groups (PersVDNA > NegVDNA). A panel ofblood-stage P. vivax antigens covering a wide range of immunogenicity confirmedthat in general PersVDNA group showed low levels of antibodies as compared withNegVDNA. Interestingly, more significant differences were observed to a novelDBPII immunogen, named DEKnull-2, which has been associated with long-termneutralizing antibody response. Differences between groups were less pronouncedwith blood-stage antigens (such as MSP1-19) whose levels can fluctuate according to malaria transmission. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In a proof-of-concept study weprovide evidence that a persistent detection of EBV-DNA in peripheral blood ofadults in a P. vivax semi-immune population may impact the long-term immuneresponse to major malaria vaccine candidates.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0265288 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, there is limitedsurveillance data on the epidemiological burden of respiratory pathogens intropical countries like Malaysia. This study aims to estimate the prevalence ofrespiratory pathogens causing ARIs among children aged <18 years old in Malaysia and their epidemiological characteristics. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimensreceived at 12 laboratories located in different states of Malaysia from2015-2019 were studied. Detection of 18 respiratory pathogens were performedusing multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Data from a total of 23,306 paediatric patients whopresented with ARI over a five-year period was studied. Of these, 18538 (79.5%)were tested positive. The most prevalent respiratory pathogens detected in thisstudy were enterovirus/ rhinovirus (6837/ 23000; 29.7%), influenza virus (5176/23000; 22.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3652/ 23000; 15.9%).Throughout the study period, RSV demonstrated the most pronounce seasonality;peak infection occurred during July to September. Whereas the influenza virus wasdetected year-round in Malaysia. No seasonal variation was noted in otherrespiratory pathogens. The risk of RSV hospitalisation was found to besignificantly higher in children aged less than two years old, whereashospitalisation rates for the influenza virus peaked at children aged between 3-6years old. CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the epidemiology and the seasonality of the causative pathogens of ARI among the paediatric population in Malaysia. Knowledge of seasonal respiratory pathogens epidemiological dynamicswill facilitate the identification of a target window for vaccination.

TI  - Diagnostic Approaches For COVID-19: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c01697 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a transmitted respiratory disease causedby the infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). Although humankind has experienced several outbreaks of infectious diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic has the highest rate of infection and has hadhigh levels of social and economic repercussions. The current COVID-19 pandemichas highlighted the limitations of existing virological tests, which have failed to be adopted at a rate to properly slow the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Pandemicpreparedness has developed as a focus of many governments around the world in theevent of a future outbreak. Despite the largely widespread availability ofvaccines, the importance of testing has not diminished to monitor the evolutionof the virus and the resulting stages of the pandemic. Therefore, developingdiagnostic technology that serves as a line of defense has become imperative. In particular, that test should satisfy three criteria to be widely adopted:simplicity, economic feasibility, and accessibility. At the heart of it all, itmust enable early diagnosis in the course of infection to reduce spread. However,diagnostic manufacturers need guidance on the optimal characteristics of avirological test to ensure pandemic preparedness and to aid in the effectivetreatment of viral infections. Nanomaterials are a decisive element in developingCOVID-19 diagnostic kits as well as a key contributor to enhance the performance of existing tests. Our objective is to develop a profile of the criteria thatshould be available in a platform as the target product. In this work, virusdetection tests were evaluated from the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic, andthen we generalized the requirements to develop a target product profile for aplatform for virus detection.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital healthcare workers in Western Switzerlandat the end of the second pandemic wave.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001558 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. In early January 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirusdisease 2019) rapidly spread from China and caused a worldwidepandemic.Hypothesis. Healthcare workers represent a high-risk group for acquiringCOVID-19 and for nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Aim. We aimed to investigate over a 1 year period, across twopandemic waves, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in employees at a WesternSwitzerland public hospital.Methodology. A prospective observational SARS-CoV-2seroprevalence study was proposed to all hospital employees who enrolled on avoluntary basis.Results. Out of 594 participants recruited on a voluntary basis, 269 volunteers (45.3 %) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: this seroprevalence wastwice higher than that reported in the local community. Healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly higher oddsratio (OR) of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology [OR 3.19, 95 % confidenceinterval (CI) 2.16-4.74]. Symptoms showing the highest association with apositive serology were anosmia (OR 11.9, 95 % CI 5.58-30.9) and ageusia (OR 10.3,95 % CI 4.8-26.3). A total of 17.1 % (95 % CI 12.2-21.1 %) of SARS-CoV-2seropositive volunteers did not report a suspicion of COVID-19 in their personal history.Conclusion. Overall, we observed that the impact of the second SARS-CoV-2pandemic wave was considerable and significantly affected healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Developing numerous nanotechnological designed tools to monitor the existence of SARS-CoV-2, and modifying its interactions address the global needs for efficientremedies required for the management of COVID-19. Herein, through amultidisciplinary outlook encompassing different fields such as thepathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, analysis of symptoms, and statistics ofneurological complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central andperipheral nervous systems have been testified. The anosmia (51.1%) and ageusia(45.5%) are reported the most frequent neurological manifestation.Cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy were mainly related to severe clinicalcases. In addition, we focus especially on the various concerned physiologicalroutes, including BBB dysfunction, which transpired due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, direct and indirect effects of the virus on the brain, and also, the plausiblemechanisms of viral entry to the nerve system. We also outline thecharacterization, and the ongoing pharmaceutical applications of quantum dots as smart nanocarriers crossing the blood-brain barrier and their importance inneurological diseases, mainly SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations Moreover, themarket status, six clinical trials recruiting quantum dots, and the challengeslimiting the clinical application of QDs are highlighted.

TI  - Effectiveness Associated With BNT162b2 Vaccine Against Emergency Department andUrgent Care Encounters for Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Infection AmongAdolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years.
PG  - e2225162
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.25162 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Data about the duration of protection of 2 and 3 doses of BNT162b2 inchildren and adolescents are needed to help inform recommendations for boostersin this age group. Objective: To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) anddurability associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against Delta- and Omicron-relatedemergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and to estimate VE associated with 3 doses against these sameoutcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This test-negative case-controlstudy was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, an integratedhealth care system using electronic health records in the US. Participantsincluded Kaiser Permanente Southern California members ages 12 to 17 years withan ED or UC encounter from November 1, 2021, through March 18, 2022, for acuterespiratory infection who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via a reversetransction-polymerase chain reaction test. Analyses were conducted from March 21 to June 22, 2022. Exposures: BNT162b2 vaccination status ascertained fromelectronic health records and state registry data. Main Outcomes and Measures:The main outcome was VE associated with BNT162b2 against ED and UC encountersrelated to Delta or Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Analyses were conducted among 3168 adolescents, including 1004 with ED visits and 2164 with UC visits. Median (IQR) age was 15 (13-16) years, and 1461 (46.1%) were boys. Inadjusted analyses, VE associated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 against ED or UCencounters was highest within the first 2 months for both Delta (89% [95% CI, 69%to 96%]) and Omicron (73% [95% CI, 54% to 84%]) variants but waned to 49% (95%CI, 27% to 65%) for the Delta variant and 16% (95% CI, -7% to 34%) for theOmicron variant at 6 months and beyond. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associatedwith improved protection against the Omicron variant (87% [95% CI, 72% to 94%])after a median (IQR) of 19 (9-32) days after dose 3. Conclusions and Relevance:These findings suggest that 2 doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine wereassociated with high levels of protection against ED and UC encounters related tothe Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the first few months aftervaccination. However, effectiveness waned over time, especially against Omicron. A third dose of BNT162b2 was associated with improved protection against Omicron beyond that seen initially after 2 doses, underscoring the importance of boostersfor adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.

TI  - Inhibition of dengue virus infection by trifluoperazine.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05555-y [doi]
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, isthe most widespread viral pathogen transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Despitethe increased incidence of DENV infection, there are no antiviral drugs availablefor treatment or prevention. Phenothiazines are heterocyclic compounds withvarious pharmacological properties that are very adaptable for drug repurposing. In the present report, we analyzed the antiviral activity against DENV and therelated Zika virus (ZIKV) of trifluoperazine (TFP), a phenothiazine derivative inclinical use as an antipsychotic and antiemetic agent. TFP exhibiteddose-dependent inhibitory activity against the four DENV serotypes and ZIKV inmonkey Vero cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations with 50% effectiveconcentration values in the range 1.6-6.4 microM. A similar level of antiviralefficacy was exhibited by TFP against flavivirus infection in the human celllines A549 and HepG2. Mechanistic studies, performed using time-dependentinfectivity assays, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescencetechniques, indicated that uncoating of the virus during penetration into thecell was the main target for TFP in infected cells, but the compound also exerteda minor effect on a late stage of the virus multiplication cycle. This studydemonstrates that TFP, a pharmacologically active phenothiazine, is a selectiveinhibitor of DENV multiplication in cell culture. Our findings open perspectives for the repositioning of phenothiazines like TFP with a wide spectrum ofantiviral efficacy as potential agents for the control of pathogenicflaviviruses.

TI  - Complete genome sequence of virulent genotype I African swine fever virus strain K49 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, isolated from a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus).
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05543-2 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever is one of the most feared infectious diseases in the pigindustry. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an enveloped, cytoplasmicdouble-stranded DNA virus and the only member of the family Asfarviridae.Although ASFV is known to have been circulating on the African continent since atleast 1921, little is known about the genetic characteristics of historical ASFV strains isolated in sub-Saharan Africa. The few complete ASFV genome sequencesobtained from African historical isolates have demonstrated genetic diversity,but the available data are limited and insufficient for fully understanding themolecular evolution and continental spread of ASFV. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the virulent ASFV strain K49, collected during an outbreak in the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1949. Thecomplete genome sequence of ASFV strain K49 was determined using an IlluminaHiSeq platform and is 189,523 bp in length with a mean GC content of 38.43%, with189 genes annotated. This is the first reported complete genome sequence of anASFV serogroup 2 isolate. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated genetic divergencewithin genotype I, and strain K49 formed a separate branch from other ASFVgenotype I isolates.

TI  - Rapid emergence of a PB2 D701N substitution during adaptation of an H9N2 avianinfluenza virus in mice.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05536-1 [doi]
AB  - H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been isolated frequently from multipleavian species and, occasionally, from humans. To explore the potential molecular basis of cross-species transmission of H9N2 AIVs, an H9N2 AIV(A/chicken/Zhejiang/221/2016) was serially passaged in mouse lung. The resultsshowed that the mouse-adapted H9N2 virus exhibited higher virulence andreplicated more efficiently in mouse lung and liver. Whole-genome sequencingshowed an amino acid substitution, D701N, in the PB2 protein, which is likelyassociated with the increased replicative ability of H9N2 virus in mice. Therapid emergence of adaptive substitutions indicates the necessity of continuousmonitoring of H9N2 virus in poultry.

TI  - Complete genome sequence of a putative novel cytorhabdovirus isolated fromRudbeckia sp.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05556-x [doi]
AB  - Through high-throughput RNA sequencing, we discovered a putative newcytorhabdovirus in the seeds of Rudbeckia sp., which we have tentatively named"rudbeckia virus 1" (RudV1). Its complete 12,502-nt genomic sequence containsfive open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 (putative nucleocapsid protein, N), ORF2(putative phosphoprotein, P), ORF3 (putative cell-to-cell movement protein, P3), ORF4 (putative matrix protein, M), and ORF5 (putative RNA-dependent RNApolymerase, L). BLASTp searches showed that ORF1, ORF3, ORF4, and ORF5 of RudV1are most closely related to the corresponding proteins of Tagetes erecta virus 1 (a putative member of the genus Cytorhabdovirus) with 33.87% (88% querycoverage), 55.98% (89% query coverage), 35.33% (94% query coverage), and 57.75%(98% query coverage) sequence identity at the amino acid level, respectively.Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparisons indicated that RudV1 is a novelmember of the genus Cytorhabdovirus within the family Rhabdoviridae.

TI  - An overview on in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of lactoferrin: itsefficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
LID - 10.1007/s10534-022-00427-z [doi]
AB  - Beyond the absolute and indisputable relevance and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccines, the rapid transmission, the severity of infection, the absence of theprotection on immunocompromised patients, the propagation of variants, the onset of infection and/or disease in vaccinated subjects and the lack of availabilityof worldwide vaccination require additional antiviral treatments. Since 1987,lactoferrin (Lf) is well-known to possess an antiviral activity related to itsphysico-chemical properties and to its ability to bind to both heparan sulfateproteoglycans (HSPGs) of host cells and/or surface components of viral particles.In the present review, we summarize in vitro and in vivo studies concerning theefficacy of Lf against DNA, RNA, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Recentstudies have revealed that the in vitro antiviral activity of Lf is alsoextendable to SARS-CoV-2. In vivo, Lf oral administration in early stage ofSARS-CoV-2 infection counteracts COVID-19 pathogenesis. In particular, the effectof Lf on SARS-CoV-2 entry, inflammatory homeostasis, iron dysregulation,iron-proteins synthesis, reactive oxygen formation, oxidative stress, gut-lungaxis regulation as well as on RNA negativization, and coagulation/fibrinolysisbalance will be critically reviewed. Moreover, the molecular mechanismsunderneath, including the Lf binding to HSPGs and spike glycoprotein, will bedisclosed and discussed. Taken together, present data not only support theapplication of the oral administration of Lf alone in asymptomatic COVID-19patients or as adjuvant of standard of care practice in symptomatic ones but alsoconstitute the basis for enriching the limited literature on Lf effectiveness forCOVID-19 treatment.

TI  - Absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in ex vivo cultured cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells.
LID - 10.1007/s00417-022-05776-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human corneal cells andtissues under standard corneal culture conditions using explants of COVID-19donors and primary cornea-derived epithelial cells. METHODS: Cornea isolated fromdeceased COVID-19 donors was cultured for 4 weeks, and SARS-CoV-2 replication wasmonitored by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, primary corneal epithelial cells from healthy donors were cultured ex vivo and infected with SARS-CoV-2 and humancytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a control. Infection status was assessed by westernblotting and reporter gene expression using green fluorescent protein-expressing viral strains. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptor expression levels in cornea andepithelial cells were assessed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 replication in 10 corneas isolated from deceased COVID-19 patients and culturedfor 4 weeks, indicating absence of infection under natural conditions.Furthermore, high-titer SARS-CoV-2 infection of ex vivo cultured cornea-derivedepithelial cells did not result in productive virus replication. In contrast, thesame cells were highly permissive for HCMV. This phenotype could potentially beexplained by low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcriptional activity in cornea andcornea-derived epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cornea andlimbal epithelial cells are refractory to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thiscould be due to the absence of robust receptor expression levels necessary forviral entry. This study adds further evidence to support the very low possibilityof transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected corneal transplant donor to arecipient in corneal organ cultures.

TI  - Early-onset fulminant neonatal sepsis caused by Multi-Drug Resistant and ESBLproducing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a late-preterm neonate: case report andliterature review.
PG  - 223-226
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a systemic condition characterized by haemodynamic changes andother clinical manifestations due to a presence of pathogenic microorganisms(bacteria, viruses, or fungi) in nor- mally sterile fluid that occurs in aninfant younger than 90 days old. Neonatal sepsis may be divided into two types:early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS).Gram-posi- tive microorganisms are the etiological agents in 62% of EOS, and in43% of the total the identified microorganism is GBS. Gram-negativemicroorganisms comprise 37% of the etiological agents of EOS, of which 29% arecaused by Escherichia coli. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae represent a majorworldwide threat among drug-resistant bacteria in both hospital and communitysettings. ESBLs are often located on large plasmids that also harbour genesresistant to other antimicrobial classes, resulting in multidrug-resistantisolates. Plasmid-encoded ESBLs of the CTX-M-type are increasingly reportedworldwide in Gram-negative rods and now account for most of the ESBLs found inEnterobacteriaceae. We present one case of EOS by Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) and ESBL producing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a neonate born to a mother recentlyimmigrated from Africa. Maternal blood culture grew the same bacteria.

PG  - 213-218
AB  - Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higherconcentrations of SARS- CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Inthis retrospective study we considered different categories of patients definedas "vulnerable" because affected by other pathologies, such as patients withgenetic and cardiovascular diseases; patients with autoimmune dermatological dis-ease; kidney and lung transplant patients, and pregnant women because theprevalence of Covid-19 infection during pregnancy is not known. This study wasperformed at IRCCS San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, North Italy, a zone consideredat high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic from June to December 2020. None of thepositive screened patients had symptoms of COVID-19 infection at the time ofinclusion in this study.

TI  - Impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and persistence of antibodyresponse.
PG  - 181-189
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women may be at an increased risk of developing severe orcritical disease associated with the Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing severities during pregnancy. Weperformed a prospective study to describe the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection onpregnancy outcomes and on the newborn, depending on the severity of the disease. The antibody response and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S) IgG, IgA andanti-Nu- cleocapsid (NCP) IgG, was investigated. METHODS: A total of 48 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled, and sequential serum samples from 30 of them were collected until one year after infection. Outcomes of pregnan- cyand newborn parameters were evaluated in comparison with 200 uninfected controls.RESULTS: Asymptomatic infection was observed in 31/48 women (64.5%), mildCOVID-19 in 12/48 women (25.0%), while 5/48 women (10.5%) developed pneumonia.Women with pneumonia mount- ed significantly higher levels of anti-S IgG, IgA andanti-NCP IgG between 1 and 3 months after onset of infection compared toasymptomatic women. Anti-S IgG persisted in the majority of women from 6 monthsto at least one year after infection, especially in those with symptomaticinfection and pneumonia, while anti-S IgA and anti-NCP IgG declined earlier.Pregnancy complications and new- born parameters were not significantly differentfrom those observed in uninfected controls. CONCLUSION: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody development and persistence was not impaired in pregnant women, while SARS-CoV-2 infection did not cause major pregnancy or newborn complications in asymptomatic or symptomatic women, nor in women with pneumonia receiving prompt clinical care.

TI  - Construction of SHERLOCK-based sgRNA for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics from Indonesia.
PG  - 173-180
AB  - Handling a pandemic requires high sensitivity, high specificity, simple, fast,and flexible tests. How- ever, conventional test methods (RT-PCR and RapidAntigen) have weaknesses in test efficiency. Specific High sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter un-LOCKing (SHERLOCK), is a new technology that can detect nucleic acidseven with limited sample preparation, but with high sensitivity, high spec-ificity, rapidly, and flexibly. The key to the specificity of the SHERLOCKdiagnostic method is the single guide RNA (sgRNA). The purpose of this study was to analyze the design of the SHERLOCK sgRNA, which has optimum potential to beused as a Cas13a marker to recognize the spike protein gene of the ReceptorBinding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 strain from Indonesia. The method used was anin-silico approach using genomic and proteomic data and molecular docking. Thisstudy used a sample of 37 genomic data representing 86 types of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mutations in Indonesia. Based on the docking candidate results, sgRNA8has the lowest energy to bind to the viral protospacer target SARS-CoV-2 and ahigh melting point value at 70.3 degrees C, indicating that the sgRNA8 chain isthe optimal candidate for sgRNA.

TI  - Hepatitis D (DELTA).
PG  - 149-154
AB  - The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is unique in animal virology. It is the smallest ofhuman pathogens, re- quires the HBsAg capsid of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) toassembly into infectious virions, and parasitizes the transcriptional machineryof the host. Hepatitis D is ubiquitous but prevalence varies throughout theworld. It is the most severe form of chronic viral liver disorder. Vaccinationagainst the HBV has decreased the circulation of HDV in industrialized countries but Hepatitis D remains a significant medical issue in many areas of thedeveloping world.

TI  - Genomic evidence for global ocean plankton biogeography shaped by large-scalecurrent systems.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.78129 [doi]
LID - e78129 [pii]
AB  - Biogeographical studies have traditionally focused on readily visible organisms, but recent technological advances are enabling analyses of the large-scaledistribution of microscopic organisms, whose biogeographical patterns have longbeen debated. Here we assessed the global structure of plankton geography and itsrelation to the biological, chemical, and physical context of the ocean (the'seascape') by analyzing metagenomes of plankton communities sampled acrossoceans during the Tara Oceans expedition, in light of environmental data andocean current transport. Using a consistent approach across organismal sizes thatprovides unprecedented resolution to measure changes in genomic compositionbetween communities, we report a pan-ocean, size-dependent plankton biogeography overlying regional heterogeneity. We found robust evidence for a basin-scaleimpact of transport by ocean currents on plankton biogeography, and on acharacteristic timescale of community dynamics going beyond simple seasonality orlife history transitions of plankton.

OAB - Oceans are brimming with life invisible to our eyes, a myriad of species ofbacteria, viruses and other microscopic organisms essential for the health of theplanet. These 'marine plankton' are unable to swim against currents and shouldtherefore be constantly on the move, yet previous studies have suggested thatdistinct species of plankton may in fact inhabit different oceanic regions.However, proving this theory has been challenging; collecting plankton islogistically difficult, and it is often impossible to distinguish between speciessimply by examining them under a microscope. However, within the last decade, aresearch schooner called Tara has travelled the globe to gather thousands ofplankton samples. At the same time, advances in genomics have made it possible toidentify species based only on fragments of their DNA sequence. To understand thehidden geography of plankton communities in Earth's oceans, Richter et al. pored over DNA from the Tara Oceans expedition. This revealed that, despite beingunable to resist the flow of water, various planktonic species which live closeto the surface manage to occupy distinct, stable provinces shaped by currents.Different sizes of plankton are distributed in different sized provinces, withthe smallest organisms tending to inhabit the smallest areas. Comparing DNAsimilarities and speeds of currents at the ocean surface revealed how these mightstretch and mix plankton communities. Plankton play a critical role in the healthof the ocean and the chemical cycles of planet Earth. These results could allowdeeper investigation by marine modellers, ecologists, and evolutionarybiologists. Meanwhile, work is already underway to investigate how climate changemight impact this hidden geography.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Bacteriophages/Phages are the viruses that infect and replicatewithin bacteria and archaea. Phages are used to therapeutically provide anotherpotential solution for solving antibiotic resistance, which is one of the threatsto global health. To develop phage therapies, the identification of phages frommetagenome sequences is the first step. Currently, there are two main methods foridentifying phages: database-based (alignment-based) methods and alignment-freemethods. Database-based methods typically use a large number of sequences asreferences; alignment-free methods usually learn the features of the sequenceswith machine learning and deep learning models. RESULTS: We propose INHERIT whichuse a deep representation learning model to integrate both database-based andalignment-free methods, combining the strengths of both. Pre-training is used as an alternative way of acquiring knowledge representations from existingdatabases, while the BERT-style deep learning framework retains the advantage of alignment-free methods. We compare INHERIT with four existing methods on athird-party benchmark dataset. Our experiments show that INHERIT achieves abetter performance with the F1-score of 0.9932. In addition, we find thatpre-training two species separately helps the non-alignment deep learning modelmake more accurate predictions. AVAILABILITY: The codes of INHERIT are nowavailable in: https://github.com/Celestial-Bai/INHERIT. SUPPLEMENTARYINFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, viraleradication is associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL).OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in HRQOL among participants receiving opioid agonisttherapy undergoing treatment for HCV infection. METHODS: COSTAR (NCT02251990) wasa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adults with HCV infectionon opioid agonist therapy received elbasvir (50 mg)/grazoprevir (100 mg) orplacebo for 12 weeks. HRQOL was evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) Acute Form. Participantsremained blinded until 4 weeks after end of treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 201participants received elbasvir/grazoprevir and 100 participants received placebo.Treatment difference mean change from baseline scores (elbasvir/grazoprevir minusplacebo) indicated an improvement in HRQOL at 4 weeks after end of treatment inparticipants receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir versus those receiving placebo,driven by declining HRQOL in those receiving placebo and improved HRQOL incertain domains among participants receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir. Notabledifferences in SF-36v2 scores were evident in the general health (mean treatment difference [MTD], 6.00; 95% CI, 1.37-10.63), vitality (MTD, 6.81; 95% CI,1.88-11.75), and mental health (MTD, 5.17; 95% CI, 0.52-9.82) domains and in the mental component summary score (mean, 2.83; 95% CI, 0.29-5.37). No notablebetween-treatment differences were evident at treatment weeks 4 or 12.CONCLUSION: HRQOL in patients receiving medication for opioid dependence wasimproved following treatment for HCV infection with elbasvir/grazoprevir,suggesting that eradication of HCV infection with direct-acting antivirals isassociated with improved HRQOL.

TI  - Interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a scoping review.
PG  - CD015270
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD015270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID-19, a disease forwhich few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death.Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 may help protect those not yet able toget vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine-resistant mutations of SARS-CoV-2may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID-19 is limited. Differentvaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy isa serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries andposes a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review mapsinterventions aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID-19vaccine hesitancy. OBJECTIVES: To scope the existing research landscape oninterventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to bevaccinated against COVID-19, increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, or decreaseCOVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressedpopulations and intervention categories. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CochraneCOVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded andEmerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirusdisease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We includedstudies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance thewillingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID-19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs), non-randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs),observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants.Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We did not limitthe scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomesassessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines fordiseases other than COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were analysedaccording to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used aninteractive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mappedthe identified interventions according to pre-specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were:communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions,incentives (both financial and non-financial), interventions to improve access,and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, theaddressed population, and whether the design was randomised-controlled or not.MAIN RESULTS: We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which areongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevantsystematic reviews. For an overview, please seethehttps://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=sharehttps://egmopenaccess.3ieimpact.org/evidence-maps/interventions-increase-covid-19-vaccine-uptake?type=share. Studies with published results Of the 61 studies withpublished results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventionsinvestigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testingcommunication strategies to enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Most studiesassessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studieswere conducted in English-speaking high-income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that wereaddressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at-risk patients, or the generalpopulation. Ongoing studies Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs andsix NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used typesof interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptakeas an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted inEnglish-speaking high-income countries. In contrast to the studies with publishedresults, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populationsrange from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students.Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022. AUTHORS'CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneousinterventions for increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccinehesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives acomprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake andcan be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness ofinterventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. A research gap was shown forstudies conducted in low and middle-income countries and studies investigatingpolicy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressingchildren and adolescents. As COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available,these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research.

TI  - Trust in healthcare providers among Chinese immigrants living with hepatitis Bvirus in Australia: A qualitative study.
LID - 10.1111/jvh.13736 [doi]
AB  - Despite the importance of trust in healthcare settings, there remains a paucityof evidence on the role it plays in patient-provider relationships and healthcareoutcomes among people living with hepatitis B virus (HBV). International evidencesuggests that Chinese immigrants living with HBV experience inequitable access,outcomes and treatment quality in CHB healthcare. This study explores individual trust in healthcare providers and its impact on health-seeking behaviours andhealth outcomes among Chinese people living with HBV in Australia. A total ofsixteen participants were recruited from the Chinese community in Sydney andMelbourne and participated in semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed within a conceptual model of trust that contains five dimensions: fidelity,competence, honesty, confidentiality and global trust. The data shows how trustin physicians was formed and influenced by factors including patient-providerinteractions, historically relevant experiences, health and illness beliefs andsystemic barriers. While the research confirms prior findings on the impact oftrust and mistrust, showing an association between low trust and treatmentnonadherence, it also generates fresh insights by examining what leads tomistrust and the role of trust in shaping participants' healthcare outcomes.Findings suggest that by treating patients with respect and dignity, improvinginterpersonal skills and cultural competency, having open discussion oncomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment and protecting privateinformation, physicians can increase patients' trust. The findings willcontribute to efforts to address HBV as a health priority and increase patients' trust in healthcare providers among Chinese immigrants living with HBV.

TI  - Estimating the potential to prevent locally acquired HIV infections in a UNAIDSFast-Track City, Amsterdam.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.76487 [doi]
LID - e76487 [pii]
AB  - Background: More than 300 cities including the city of Amsterdam in theNetherlands have joined the UNAIDS Fast-Track Cities initiative, committing toaccelerate their HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic in cities by 2030. Tosupport this commitment, we aimed to estimate the number and proportion ofAmsterdam HIV infections that originated within the city, from Amsterdamresidents. We also aimed to estimate the proportion of recent HIV infectionsduring the 5-year period 2014-2018 in Amsterdam that remained undiagnosed.Methods: We located diagnosed HIV infections in Amsterdam using postcode data(PC4) at time of registration in the ATHENA observational HIV cohort, and usedHIV sequence data to reconstruct phylogeographically distinct, partially observedAmsterdam transmission chains. Individual-level infection times were estimatedfrom biomarker data, and used to date the phylogenetically observed transmission chains as well as to estimate undiagnosed proportions among recent infections. A Bayesian Negative Binomial branching process model was used to estimate thenumber, size and growth of the unobserved Amsterdam transmission chains from the partially observed phylogenetic data. Results: Between January 1 2014 and May 12019, there were 846 HIV diagnoses in Amsterdam residents, of whom 516 (61%) wereestimated to have been infected in 2014-2018. The rate of new Amsterdam diagnosessince 2014 (104 per 100,000) remained higher than the national rates excludingAmsterdam (24 per 100,000), and in this sense Amsterdam remained a HIV hotspot inthe Netherlands. An estimated 14% [12-16%] of infections in Amsterdan MSM in2014-2018 remained undiagnosed by May 1 2019, and 41% [35-48%] in Amsterdamheterosexuals, with variation by region of birth. An estimated 68% [61-74%] ofAmsterdam MSM infections in 2014-2018 had an Amsterdam resident as source, and57% [41-71%] in Amsterdam heterosexuals, with heterogeneity by region of birth.Of the locally acquired infections, an estimated 43% [37-49%] were inforeign-born MSM, 41% [35-47%] in Dutch-born MSM, 10% [6-18%] in foreign-bornheterosexuals, and 5% [2-9%] in Dutch-born heterosexuals. We estimate themajority of Amsterdam MSM infections in 2014-2018 originated in transmissionchains that pre-existed by 2014. Conclusions: This combined phylogenetic,epidemiologic, and modelling analysis in the UNAIDS Fast-Track City Amsterdamindicates that there remains considerable potential to prevent HIV infectionsamong Amsterdam residents through city-level interventions. The burden of locallyacquired infection remains concentrated in MSM, and both Dutch-born andforeign-born MSM would likely benefit most from intensified city-levelinterventions.

TI  - Proteomic Profiling of Hypoplastic Lungs Suggests an Underlying InflammatoryResponse in the Pathogenesis of Abnormal Lung Development in CongenitalDiaphragmatic Hernia.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005656 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of lung hypoplasia in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), acommon birth defect, is poorly understood. The diaphragmatic defect can berepaired surgically, but the abnormal lung development contributes to a highmortality in these patients. To understand the underlying pathobiology, wecompared the proteomic profiles of fetal rat lungs at the alveolar stage (E21)that were either exposed to nitrofen in utero (CDH lungs, n=5) or exposed tovehicle only (non-CDH control lungs, n=5). Pathway analysis of proteomic datasetsshowed significant enrichment in inflammatory response proteins associated withcytokine signaling and Epstein Barr Virus in nitrofen CDH lungs. Amongst the 218 significantly altered proteins between CDH and non-CDH control lungs wereTenascin C, CREBBP, LYN and STAT3. We showed that Tenascin C was decreased aroundthe distal airway branches in nitrofen rat lungs and human CDH lungs, obtainedfrom stillborn fetuses that did not receive pre- or postnatal treatment. Incontrast, STAT3 was significantly increased in the airway epithelium of nitrofen lungs at E21. STAT3 inhibition after direct nitrofen exposure to fetal rat lungexplants (E14.5) partially rescued the hypoplastic lung phenotype ex vivo byincreasing peripheral lung budding. Moreover, we demonstrated that several STAT3 associated cytokines (IL-15, IL-9, IL-2) are increased in fetal trachealaspirates of CDH survivors compared to non-survivors after fetoscopic endoluminaltracheal occlusion. With our unbiased proteomics approach, we showed for thefirst time that downstream inflammatory processes are likely involved in thepathogenesis of abnormal lung development in CDH.

TI  - SLIDE: Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Self-Testing with RT-LAMP in a Mobile Device.
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c01023 [doi]
AB  - Regular, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive self-testing for severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed to quellpandemic propagation. The existing at-home nucleic acid testing (NAT) test hashigh sensitivity and specificity, but it requires users to mail the sample to thecentral lab, which often takes 3-5 days to obtain the results. On the other hand,rapid antigen tests for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen provide a fast sample to answerthe test (15 min). However, the sensitivity of antigen tests is 30 to 40% lowerthan nucleic acid testing, which could miss a significant portion of infectedpatients. Here, we developed a fully integrated SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) device using a self-collectedsaliva sample. This platform can automatically handle the complexity and canperform the functions, including (1) virus particles' thermal lysis preparation, (2) sample dispensing, (3) target sequence RT-LAMP amplification, (4) real-timedetection, and (5) result report and communication. With a turnaround time ofless than 45 min, our device achieved the limit of detection (LoD) of 5copies/muL of the saliva sample, which is comparable with the LoD (6 copies/muL) using FDA-approved quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)assays with the same heat-lysis saliva sample preparation method. With clinicalsamples, our platform showed a good agreement with the results from thegold-standard RT-PCR method. These results show that our platform can performself-administrated SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by laypersons with noninvasivesaliva samples. We believe that our self-testing platform will have an ongoingbenefit for COVID-19 control and fighting future pandemics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Respiratory Syndromes Surveillance System was created by theBrazilian Ministry of Health in 2000 to monitor influenza in this country. Withthe emergence of the new coronavirus pandemic, it became incorporated into thesurveillance network for influenza and other respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVE: Toanalyze the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the state of Acre through its hierarchical urbannetwork. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, descriptive and ecological study,using a spatiotemporal approach and using secondary data. This study wasconducted in the state of Acre, northern Brazil. METHODS: This study usedsecondary data, and epidemiological weeks and municipalities were taken to be theunits of analysis. Incidence rates and kernel intensities were calculated forfour study periods. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed using scan statisticsto identify clusters of SARS cases and considering the population of eachmunicipality. RESULTS: In general, it could be observed that there were higherkernel rates and intensities in municipalities located in the north and south of this state (i.e. its most populous municipalities). CONCLUSION: Priority areasfor interventions to control transmission of COVID-19 were highlighted, with the aim of reducing the risks of transmission to more distant areas in the urbanhierarchy of the state of Acre.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During childhood and adolescence, there are significant increases in bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). OBJECTIVE: Toinvestigate physical growth parameters associated with BMD and BMC among childrenand adolescents diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DESIGN ANDSETTING: Cross-sectional study conducted in Florianopolis, Brazil, among 63children and adolescents (aged 8-15 years) diagnosed with HIV. METHOD: BMD, BMCand fat percentage z score were evaluated using dual X-ray absorptiometry.Age/height z score and body mass index (BMI)/age z score were obtained inaccordance with international recommendations, and bone age was obtained through hand-wrist radiography. Sex, family income, information on HIV infection (T CD4+ lymphocyte count, viral load and type of antiretroviral therapy,moderate-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior) were used asadjustment variables in the analyses. Simple and multiple linear regressionanalyses were performed, with a significance level of P </= 0.05. RESULTS:Subtotal BMD (without the head region) was directly associated with bone age,BMI/age z score and fat percentage z score, even after adjusting for covariates. Subtotal BMC/height was directly associated with bone age, height/age z score,BMI/age z score and fat percentage z score, even after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Subtotal BMD and subtotal BMC/height were directly associated withphysical growth indicators among children and adolescents diagnosed with HIV.

AB  - This study aimed to describe the management and results of the test event forevaluating relaxation of social distancing measures in Santa Catarina, Brazil.This is an experience report that described results of the test event carried outin July 2021 and for which the participants underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction diagnostic testing 72-48 hours before the event and had follow-up for 15days afterwards. The outcomes analyzed were SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 14 daysafter the event and presence of symptoms. Among 313 participants, the mean agewas 45.1 years and 54.3% were female. During follow-up, 7.7% (24) of thecontacted participants reported symptoms compatible with infection, but of the240 who attended post-event testing, none of the results detected the presence ofthe virus. No post-event COVID-19 cases were reported. We suggest that other testevents be carried out to evaluate the recommendations indicated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the Brazilian panorama of the training of nurses during theCOVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: a cross-sectional study, carried out with 335coordinators of undergraduate courses in Nursing and online data collection,between November 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: All Brazilian states wererepresented. Of Higher Education Institutions, 52.5% adopted remote learningwithin 10 days after determining social distancing and 23% after 100 days; 73.4% kept the students in a mandatory curricular internship. Practical classes had areduction in the number of students per group (46.0%). Most faculty and students were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 and showed worsening in mental health.CONCLUSIONS: The study identified heterogeneity in the resumption of activities, through remote teaching, which mostly occurred synchronously. There was aresumption of curricular internships and practical classes in health services,with a limitation on the number of students per field.

PG  - 206-211
LID - 10.23736/S2724-6329.22.04627-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A quick diagnosis is crucial in effectively limiting the spread ofSARS-CoV-2. The study aims to assess the prevalence of positive rapid tests inprivate dental practices. METHODS: This is an observational study. 532 COVID-19rapid nasopharyngeal antigen tests were carried out in the Veneto region ofItaly. Patients of 4 dental practices in different cities (Caorle, Montebelluna, Treviso and Vicenza) were screened with a rapid test (Rapid Test COVID-19 Agimmunochromatographic assay, Techno Genetics) throughout November and December2020. All the positive results from rapid tests were further investigated with a molecular test (PCR). All the patients tested showed no symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and had already undergone triage and temperaturemeasurement. In total 532 tests were taken: 202 in Caorle (Venice), 130 inMontebelluna (Treviso), 100 in Treviso, and 100 in Vicenza. Statistical analysis was carried with the computing environment R version 3.2.1 (R Foundation forStatistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). In particular, R was used for estimatingthe P value of the chi(2) test. The test was considered significant if the Pvalue was lower or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of the rapid tests thatresulted positive was 7.14% (38 out of 532 in total, 22 out of 202 in Caorle, 6out of 130 in Montebelluna, 4 out of 100 in Treviso and 6 out of 100 in Vicenza).Among these patients, 36 tested positive also with a molecular test (94.74%), in particular, 21 in Caorle, 5 in Montebelluna, 4 in Treviso, and 6 in Vicenza.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of positive patients screened with a rapid test inprivate dental practices stands at 7.14% and it was confirmed in most of thepatients with molecular tests. Therefore, in high-risk environments like dentalpractices, it is imperative to follow all the precautionary measures, and having every patient tested with a rapid test could be taken into consideration to limitthe spread of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Epidemiological information on hepatitis A among people living with HIV (PLHIV)in Korea is scarce. This retrospective study was performed at a tertiary carehospital and included 756 PLHIV with anti- hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgG tests.Between 2012 and 2021, the age at anti-HAV IgG seroconversion is graduallydelayed, and the proportion of individuals susceptible to HAV infection increasedamong adult PLHIV in Korea. The independent risk factors for HAV seropositivitywere female sex and HBs antigen (Ag) positivity. Therefore, HAV vaccination ishighly recommended for young PLHIV, especially for women or HBsAg-positiveindividuals.

TI  - Weight Gain and Lipid Profile Changes in Koreans with Human ImmunodeficiencyVirus undergoing Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor-Based Regimens.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2022.0063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explored the relationship between integrase strandtransfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based anti-retroviral agents and weight gain overtime, and the risk factors for weight gain in Korean people living with humanimmunodeficiency virus (PLWH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conductedretrospectively in PLWHs 18 years of age or older who took one of threeINSTI-based single-tablet regimens (STRs) (tenofovir disoproxilfumarate/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat [TDF/F/EVG/c], tenofoviralafenamide/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat [TAF/F/EVG/c], andabacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir [ABC/3TC/DTG]) for more than 2 years at threeuniversity-affiliated hospitals in South Korea from May 2014 to December 2020.Analysis was performed in the treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups,respectively. RESULTS: Individual INSTI-based STRs were associated with weightgain at the 24-month follow up in both treatment-naive (n = 179) andtreatment-experienced (n = 290) groups. Body mass index (BMI) categories changed over time for TAF/F/EVG/c and ABC/3TC/DTG, with significant increases in therates of overweight and obesity in treatment-naive patients, whereas there was nochange for TDF/F/EVG/c. TAF/F/EVG/c significantly increased total cholesterol(TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) comparedto other regimens over 24 months. In the treatment-naive group, a baseline CD4(+)T cell count <100 cells/mm(3), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (VL)>/=100,000 copies/mL, no physical exercise, and TAF/F/EVG/c (vs. TDF/F/EVF/c)were risk factors for >/=10% weight gain. In the treatment-experienced group, age<45 years, BMI <25 kg/m(2), and no physical exercise were risk factors for >/=5% weight gain. CONCLUSION: INSTI-based STR continued to increase body weight at the24-month follow up in treated and untreated Korean PLWH. Exercise, together with demographic-, HIV-, and anti-retroviral therapy-related factors, influencedweight gain. Therefore, when prescribing an INSTI-based STR, weight gain andmetabolic changes should be closely monitored in PLWH with these risk factors.

TI  - Comparison of Three Cardiovascular Risk Scores among HIV-Infected Patients inKorea: The Korea HIV/AIDS Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3947/ic.2022.0048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk factors for CVD,and applicability of the three known CVD risk equations in the Korean humanimmunodeficiency virus/ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) cohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study parcitipants were HIV-infected patients in aKorean HIV/AIDS cohort enrolled from 19 hospitals between 2006 and 2017. Datacollected at entry to the cohort were analyzed. The 5-year CVD risk in eachparticipant was calculated using three CVD risk equations: reduced CVD predictionmodel of HIV-specific data collection on adverse effects of anti-HIV drugs(R-DAD), Framingham general CVD risk score (FRS), and Korean Coronary HeartDisease Risk Score (KRS). RESULTS: CVD events were observed in 11 of 586HIV-infected patients during a 5-year (median) follow-up period. The incidence ofCVD was 4.11 per 1,000 person-years. Older age (64 vs. 41 years, P = 0.005) anddiabetes mellitus (45.5% vs. 6.4%, P <0.001) were more frequent in patients with CVD. Using R-DAD, FRS, and KRS, 1.9%, 2.4%, and 0.7% of patients, respectively,were considered to have a very high risk (>/=10%) of 5-year CVD. Thediscriminatory capacities of the three prediction models were good, withc-statistic values of 0.829 (P <0.001) for R-DAD, 0.824 (P <0.001) for FRS, and0.850 (P = 0.001) for KRS. CONCLUSION: The FRS, R-DAD, and KRS performed well in the Korean HIV/AIDS cohort. A larger cohort and a longer period of follow-up may be necessary to demonstrate the risk factors and develop an independent CVD risk prediction model specific to Korean patients with HIV.

AB  - Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) is an important pathogen, leading to the occurrence ofviral diarrhoea . As the infection displays obvious enterotropism, intestinalmucosal immunity is the significant line of defence against pathogen invasion.Moreover, as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show acid resistance, bile saltresistance and immune regulation, it is of great significance to develop an oral vaccine. Most traditional plasmid delivery vectors use antibiotic genes asselective markers, easily leading to antibiotic accumulation. Therefore, toselect a food-grade marker in genetically engineering food-grade microorganismsis vital. Based on the CRISPR-Cas9D10A system, we constructed a stableauxotrophic Lactobacillus paracasei HLJ-27 (Lactobacillus big up tri, openAlrHLJ-27) strain. In addition, as many plasmids replicate in the host bacteria,resulting in internal gene deletions. In this study,we used atemperature-sensitive gene editing plasmidto insert the VP4 gene into the genome,yielding the insertion mutant strains VP4/ big up tri, openAlr HLJ-27, VP4/ bigup tri, openAlr W56, and VP4/W56. This recombinant bacterium efficiently induced secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses. These oral mucosal vaccines have the potential to actas an alternative to the application of antibiotics in the future and induceefficient immune responses against PEDV infection.

PG  - 725-735
LID - 10.3724/abbs.2022049 [doi]
AB  - APOBEC3G (A3G) is a member of cytosine deaminase family with a variety of innate immune functions. It displays activities against retrovirus and retrotransposonby inhibition of virus infectivity factor (Vif)-deficient HIV-1 replication. The interaction between A3G N-terminal domain and Vif directs the cellular Cullin 5E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to ubiquitinate A3G, and leads to A3G proteasomaldegradation, which is a potential target for anti-HIV drug. Currently, there are very few reports about stable small molecules targeting the interaction betweenA3G and Vif. In this study, we screened two series of small molecules containing carbamyl sulfamide bond or disulfide bond as bridges of two different aromaticrings. Five asymmetrical disulfides were successfully identified againstinteraction between A3G and Vif with the IC 50 values close to or smaller than 1 muM, especially, not through covalently binding with A3G or Vif. They restore theA3G expression in the presence of Vif by inhibiting Vif-induced A3Gubiquitination and degradation. This study opens a way to the discovery of newanti-HIV drugs.

TI  - Targeting PIM2 by JP11646 results in significant antitumor effects in solidtumors.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5404 [doi]
LID - 114 [pii]
AB  - Proviral integration of Moloney virus 2 (PIM2) is a prosurvival factor of cancer cells and a possible therapeutic target in hematological malignancies. However,the attempts at inhibiting PIM2 have yielded underwhelming results in earlyclinical trials on hematological malignancies. Recently, a novel panPIMinhibitor, JP11646, was developed. The present study examined the utility oftargeting PIM2 in multiple solid cancers and investigated the antitumor efficacy and the mechanisms of action of JP11646. When PIM2 expression was comparedbetween normal and cancer tissues in publicly available datasets, PIM2 was found to be overexpressed in several types of solid cancers. PIM2 ectopicoverexpression promoted tumor growth in in vivo xenograft breast cancer mousemodels. The panPIM inhibitor, JP11646, suppressed in vitro cancer cellproliferation in a concentrationdependent manner in multiple types of cancers; a similar result was observed with siRNAmediated PIM2 knockdown, as well as anincreased in cell apoptosis. By contrast, another panPIM inhibitor, AZD1208,suppressed the expression of downstream PIM2 targets, but not PIM2 proteinexpression, corresponding to no apoptosis induction. As a mechanism of PIM2protein degradation, it was found that the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib,reversed the apoptosis induced by JP11646, suggesting that PIM2 degradation byJP11646 is proteasomedependent. JP11646 exhibited significant anticancer efficacywith minimal toxicities at the examined doses and schedules in multiple in vivomice xenograft solid cancer models. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that PIM2 promotes cancer progression in solid tumors. JP11646 induces apoptosis at least partly by PIM2 protein degradation and suppresses cancer cellproliferation in vitro and in vivo. JP11646 may thus be a possible treatmentstrategy for multiple types of solid cancers.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas-based tools for the targeted control of plant viruses.
LID - 10.1111/mpp.13252 [doi]
AB  - Plant viruses are known to infect most economically important crops and pose amajor threat to global food security. Currently, few resistant host phenotypeshave been delineated, and while chemicals are used for crop protection againstinsect pests and bacterial or fungal diseases, these are inefficient againstviral diseases. Genetic engineering emerged as a way of modifying the plantgenome by introducing functional genes in plants to improve crop productivityunder adverse environmental conditions. Recently, new breeding technologies, and in particular the exciting CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) technology, was shown to be apowerful alternative to engineer resistance against plant viruses, thus has greatpotential for reducing crop losses and improving plant productivity to directlycontribute to food security. Indeed, it could circumvent the "Geneticmodification" issues because it allows for genome editing without the integrationof foreign DNA or RNA into the genome of the host plant, and it is simpler andmore versatile than other new breeding technologies. In this review, we describe the predominant features of the major CRISPR/Cas systems and outline strategiesfor the delivery of CRISPR/Cas reagents to plant cells. We also provide anoverview of recent advances that have engineered CRISPR/Cas-based resistanceagainst DNA and RNA viruses in plants through the targeted manipulation of eitherthe viral genome or susceptibility factors of the host plant genome. Finally, we provide insight into the limitations and challenges that CRISPR/Cas technologycurrently faces and discuss a few alternative applications of the technology invirus research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), the causative agent of classical swine fever (CFS), is a highly contagious disease that poses a serious threat to Chinese pig populations. OBJECTIVES: Many provinces of China, such as Shandong,Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces, have reported epidemics ofCSFV, while the references to the epidemic of CSFV in Yunnan province are rare.This study examined the epidemic characteristics of the CSFV in Yunnan province. METHODS: In this study, 326 tissue samples were collected from different regions in Yunnan province from 2015 to 2021. A reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR), sequences analysis, and phylogenetic analysis were performedfor the pathogenic detection and analysis of these 326 clinical specimens.RESULTS: Approximately 3.37% (11/326) of specimens tested positive for the CSFVby RT-PCR, which is lower than that of other regions of China. Sequence analysis of the partial E2 sequences of eleven CSFV strains showed that they shared89.0-100.0% nucleotide (nt) and 95.0-100.0% amino acid (aa) homology,respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel isolates belonged to the subgenotypes 2.1c and 2.1d, with subgenotype 2.1c being predominant.CONCLUSIONS: The CSFV was sporadic in China's Yunnan province from 2015 to 2021. Both 2.1c and 2.1d subgenotypes were found in this region, but 2.1c was dominant.

AB  - This paper reports a presumptive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cat. A cat with respiratory disease living with threeindividuals with coronavirus disease 2019 showed bilateral ground-glass opacitiesin the lung on X-ray and computed tomography. The clinical swabs were negativefor SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but the serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Interstitial pneumonia and prominent type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia were noted on histopathology. Respiratory tissues were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen, but the cat was positive for feline parvovirus DNA. In conclusion, therespiratory disease and associated pathology in this cat could have been due toexposure to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The commercially available Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines weredeveloped based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates genetically divergentfrom field strains that can only prevent clinical disease, not shedding ofvirulent heterologous virus, highlighting the need to develop genotype-matchedvaccines. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the efficacy of the NDVgenotype-matched vaccine, mIBS025 strain formulated in standard vaccinestabilizer, and in carboxymethyl sago starch-acid hydrogel (CMSS-AH) followingvaccination via an eye drop (ED) and drinking water (DW). METHODS: A challengevirus was prepared from a recent NDV isolated from ND vaccinated flock. Groups ofspecific-pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with mIBS025 vaccine strainprepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer and CMSS-AH via ED and DW and thenchallenged with the UPM/NDV/IBS362/2016 strain. RESULTS: Chickens vaccinated withCMSS-AH mIBS025 ED (group 2) developed the earliest and highest Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) NDV antibody titer (8log2) followed by standard mIBS025 ED (group3) (7log2) both conferred complete protection and drastically reduced virusshedding. By contrast, chickens vaccinated with standard mIBS025 DW (group 5) andCMSS-AH mIBS025 DW (group 4) developed low HI NDV antibody titers of 4log2 and3log2, respectively, which correspondingly conferred only 50% and 60% protection and continuously shed the virulent virus via the oropharyngeal and cloacal routesuntil the end of the study at 14 dpc. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of mIBS025vaccines prepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer or CMSS-AH was affected by thevaccination routes. The groups vaccinated via ED had better protective immunitythan those vaccinated via DW.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 evolution and patient immunological history shape the breadth andpotency of antibody-mediated immunity.
LID - jiac332 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac332 [doi]
AB  - Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinctSARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/orvaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediatedresponse is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responsesagainst SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha, SARS-CoV-2delta and SARS-CoV-2omicronpseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories,including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2alpha orSARS-CoV-2delta, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadthand potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, thevariant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and thatindividuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposureexhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that theinterplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape theantigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with importantimplications for future vaccine design.

TI  - Tick-Borne Pathogens in Questing Blacklegged Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) From PikeCounty, Pennsylvania.
LID - tjac107 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac107 [doi]
AB  - Active surveillance was conducted by collecting questing ticks from vegetationthrough a 2-yr survey in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Over a thousand blackleggedticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) and American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say)were collected. A single specimen of the following species was collected: lonestar tick (Amblyomma americanum L.), rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris Packard), and an Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann). This study represents the largest county-wide study in Pennsylvania, surveying 988questing I. scapularis adult and nymphs. Molecular detection of five distincttick-borne pathogens was screened through real-time PCR at a single tickresolution. Respectively, the overall 2-yr adult and nymph prevalence werehighest with Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetacceae) (45.99%,18.94%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) (12.29%,7.95%) where the variant-ha (8.29%, 3.03%) was overall more prevalent than thevariant-v1 (2.49%, 4.17%), Babesia microti (Piroplasmida: Babesiidae) (4.97%,5.30%), Borrelia miyamotoi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) (1.38%, 1.89%), and Powassan virus lineage II [POWV]/deer tick virus (DTV) (2.07%, 0.76%). Adult and nymph coinfection prevalence of B. burgdorferi and B. microti (3.03%, 4.97%) and adult coinfection of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum or A. phagocytophilum and B. microti were significantly higher than the independent infection rateexpected naturally. This study highlights the urgency to conduct diversesurveillance studies with large sample sizes to better understand the human risk for tick-borne diseases within small geographical areas.

TI  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceuticals in wastewater treated forbeneficial reuse: Two case studies in central Pennsylvania.
LID - 10.1002/jeq2.20398 [doi]
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance was leveraged as a powerfultool for monitoring community-scale health. Further, the well-known persistenceof some pharmaceuticals through wastewater treatment plants spurred concerns thatincreased usage of pharmaceuticals during the pandemic would increase theconcentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluent. We collected weeklyinfluent and effluent samples from May 2020 through May 2021 from two wastewater treatment plants in central Pennsylvania, the Penn State Water ReclamationFacility and the University Area Joint Authority, that provide effluent forbeneficial reuse, including for irrigation. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 (influent only), two over-the-counter medicines (acetaminophen and naproxen),five antibiotics (ampicillin, doxycycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, andtrimethoprim), two therapeutic agents (remdesivir and dexamethasone), andhydroxychloroquine. While there were no correlations between pharmaceutical andvirus concentration, remdesivir detection occurred when the number ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients increased and dexamethasone detection co-occurred with the presence of COVID-19 patients on ventilators. Additionally, Penn Statedecision-making regarding instruction modes explained the temporal variation ofinfluent pharmaceutical concentrations, with detection occurring primarily whenstudents were on campus. Risk quotients calculated for pharmaceuticals with knownEC50 or LC50 values for fish, daphnia, and algae were generally low in theeffluent; however, some acute risks from sulfamethoxazole and dexamethasone were high when students returned to campus. Remdesivir and dexamethasone persistedthrough the wastewater treatment plants, thereby introducing novelpharmaceuticals directly to soils and surface water. These results highlightconnections between human health and water quality during and further demonstratebroad utility of wastewater surveillance.

TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus infection and risks of morbidity and death in adultswith incident heart failure.
PG  - oeab040
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeab040 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases the risk of heart failure(HF), but whether it influences subsequent morbidity and mortality remainsunclear. Methods and results: We investigated the risks of hospitalization forHF, HF-related emergency department (ED) visits, and all-cause death in anobservational cohort of incident HF patients with and without HIV using data fromthree large US integrated healthcare delivery systems. We estimated incidencerates and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) by HIV status at the time of HF diagnosisfor subsequent outcomes. We identified 448 persons living with HIV (PLWH) and3429 without HIV who developed HF from a frequency-matched source cohort of 38868 PLWH and 386 586 without HIV. Mean age was 59.5 +/- 11.3 years with 9.8%women and 31.8% Black, 13.1% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian/Pacific Islander. Compared with persons without HIV, PLWH had similar adjusted rates of HF hospitalization[aHR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-1.26] and of HF-related ED visits[aHR 1.22 (95% CI: 0.99-1.50)], but higher adjusted rates of all-cause death [aHR1.31 (95% CI: 1.08-1.58)]. Adjusted rates of HF-related morbidity and all-causedeath were directionally consistent across a wide range of CD4 counts but mostpronounced in the subset with a baseline CD4 count <200 or 200-499 cells/muL.Conclusion: In a large, diverse cohort of adults with incident HF receiving care within integrated healthcare delivery systems, PLWH were at an independentlyhigher risk of all-cause death but not HF hospitalizations or HF-related EDvisits. Future studies investigating modifiable HIV-specific risk factors mayfacilitate more personalized care to optimize outcomes for PLWH and HF.

AB  - China experienced a resurgence of seasonal influenza activity throughout 2021despite intermittent control measures and prolonged international border closure.We show genomic evidence for multiple A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B/Victoriatransmission lineages circulating over 3 years, with the 2021 resurgence mainlydriven by two B/Victoria clades. Phylodynamic analysis revealed unsampledancestry prior to widespread outbreaks in December 2020, showing that influenzalineages can circulate cryptically under non-pharmaceutical interventions enactedagainst COVID-19. Novel haemagglutinin gene mutations and altered age profiles ofinfected individuals were observed, and Jiangxi province was identified as amajor source for nationwide outbreaks. Following major holiday periods,fluctuations in the effective reproduction number were observed, underscoring theimportance of influenza vaccination prior to holiday periods or travel. Extensiveheterogeneity in seasonal influenza circulation patterns in China determined byhistorical strain circulation indicates that a better understanding ofdemographic patterns is needed for improving effective controls.

AB  - Human ACE2 Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the key cellattachment and entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), with the original SARS-CoV-2 isolates unable to use mouse ACE2(mACE2). Herein we describe the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 strain capable ofACE2-independent infection and the evolution of mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro serial passaging of virus in co-cultures of cell lines expressing hACE2 and mACE2. MA viruses evolved with up to five amino acid changes in the spikeprotein, all of which have been seen in human isolates. MA viruses replicated to high titers in C57BL/6J mouse lungs and nasal turbinates and causedcharacteristic lung histopathology. One MA virus also evolved to replicateefficiently in several ACE2-negative cell lines across several species, includingclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associatedprotein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) ACE2 knockout cells. An E484D substitution is likelyinvolved in ACE2-independent entry and has appeared in only approximately 0.003per cent of human isolates globally, suggesting that it provided no significantselection advantage in humans. ACE2-independent entry reveals a SARS-CoV-2infection mechanism that has potential implications for disease pathogenesis,evolution, tropism, and perhaps also intervention development.

TI  - Investigation of the target genes of BLV miRNAs and the expression levels ofmiR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p in cattle infected with Bovine Leukemia Virus.
PG  - 265-274
LID - 10.30466/vrf.2020.123330.2908 [doi]
AB  - Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is an oncogenic retrovirus of the genusDeltaretrovirus. The genome of BLV encodes a cluster of 10 mature microRNAs(miRNAs). Considering the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene expression, it seems that each of the miRNAs of BLV plays a vital role in the process ofpathogenesis and tumorigenesis of the virus. First, sequences of each of themiRNAs of BLV were selected and downloaded from the miRBase database. Thesequences were then investigated using TargetScan and miRWalk to identify target genes of each of the mature miRNAs of the virus. Second, the expression levels ofthe two miRNAs with the highest number of target genes in B lymphocytes andlymphoid tissues were evaluated using qPCR and were compared between cattle with different forms of BLV infection: PL form was compared to aleukemic (AL) form(Group 1) and BLV+ with normal lymph nodes were compared to lymphosarcoma form(Group 2). We identified a total of 1595 target genes of the micro RNAs. ThemiRNAs with the highest target genes included miR-B4-3p with 760 and B2-5p with102 target genes. In the second phase, miRNA expression in BLV-infected animalswas investigated. The Fold Change (FC) values for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p ingroup 1 were 22 and 67, respectively. In the second group, the FCs for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p were 47 and 133, respectively. The expression was significantlyhigher in persistent lymphocytosis (PL) cattle in group one and lymphosarcomacattle in group two.

PG  - 627-630
LID - 10.46234/ccdcw2022.139 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem in China. In2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a goal to eliminate viralhepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, and in 2018, the National HealthCommission of China launched Hepatitis C Elimination Action by 2030. Hepatitis C control and prevention has made significant progress in China in recent years. Toimplement the "Healthy China 2030" plan and the Healthy China Initiative(2019-2030), and to contribute to the global target of eliminating viralhepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, the National Health Commission ofChina and eight other government departments jointly issued the National ActionPlan for Eliminating Hepatitis C as a Public Health Threat (2021-2030)(hereinafter referred to as the "National Plan") in 2021. The National Plan hasan overarching goal and 15 specific targets that cover health education,comprehensive prevention interventions, testing and treatment, and capacitybuilding. The National Plan introduces key tasks and strategies of "fivestrengthenings, one expanding, and one implementation," i.e., strengtheninghealth education, comprehensive prevention, referral and treatment, drug supply, and information management; expanding testing; and implementing relevant medical insurance policies. The National Plan also proposes key guaranteeing measures of "four intensifications and one mobilization," i.e., intensification oforganizational leadership, capacity building, scientific research andinternational cooperation, and supervision and fulfillment; mobilization ofsocial participation. The National Plan is an important component of the Healthy China initiative, adhering to the integration of treatment and prevention anddeepening the "integration of medical treatment, medical insurance, and medicine supplies." In this review, we describe the National Plan and discuss itschallenges and prospects.

LID - 10.7150/ijms.71286 [doi]
AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune response and produces protectiveantibodies, and these changes may persist after patients discharged fromhospital. Methods: This study conducted a one-year follow-up study on patientswith COVID-19 to observe the dynamic changes of circulating leukocyte subsets andvirus-specific antibodies. Results: A total of 66 patients with COVID-19 and 213 healthy patients with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were included. Thevirus-specific total antibody, IgG and IgM antibody of patients after one year ofrecovery were higher than those of healthy vaccinated participants (94.13 vs4.65, 2.67 vs 0.44, 0.09 vs 0.06, respectively) (P < 0.001). Neutrophil count (OR= 1.73, 95% CI: 1.10-2.70, P = 0.016) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR =1.59, 95% CI: 1.05-2.41, P = 0.030) at discharge were the influencing factors forthe positivity of virus-specific IgG antibody in patients after one year ofrecovery. The counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and NK cells increased with the timeof recovery, and remained basically stable from 9 to 12 months after discharge.After 12 months, the positivity of IgG antibody was 85.3% and IgM was 11.8%,while the virus-specific antibody changed dynamically in patients within one yearafter discharge. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody of recoveredpatients showed dynamic fluctuation after discharge, while the leukocyte subsets gradually increased and basically stabilized after 9 months.

TI  - Assessing health-related behaviors among Jordanian children during COVID-19pandemic: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 2670
LID - 10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2670 [doi]
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) led to extreme actions being taken by the governments to restrict the spread of this virus.Closure of schools, sport clubs and playgrounds were among these actions;children had to stay indoors and were not allowed to pursue their normallifestyle activities. Objectives: To assess the differences in health-relatedbehaviors among Jordanian school-aged children (6-16 years) before and duringCOVID-19 quarantine and to evaluate public's perception of the role ofpharmacists regarding children's health-related behaviors management. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to January 2021 using ananonymous web-based survey. The survey was developed based on previouslypublished surveys. Evaluation of the validity and reliability of the survey were conducted by a professional committee of clinical pharmacists and a statistician.Results: A total of 230 children, aged 9.02+/- 2.977 participated in the study.Physical activity and healthy balanced meals decreased (less than 1 hr or 1-3hrs/week vs 2 meals/day, p= <0.001), whereas daily screen time (1-3 hrs/week vs4-6 hrs/week, p= <0.001), sleep hours (8-9 hrs/day vs 10-11 hrs/day, p= <0.001)and the ingestion of unhealthy snacks had increased (1-2 meals/day vs. 2-3meals/day, p=<0.001). A positive perception of pharmacists' role during thepandemic was revealed. Conclusion: The present study showed that a significantchange in children's health-related behavior happened during the COVID-19pandemic. Such changes can lead to social, physical and mental health problems.The public perceived community pharmacists as trusted health care professionalsduring the pandemic.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the co-infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) amongpatients with asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 in Jordan. Also, to determine the frequency of acute asthma exacerbation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic ona matched basis. Methods: The data of this prospective cohort research consisted of clinical variables. During the first visit, and after 14-days, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed forHRV and SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results: Forty-seven out of 175 (26.9%) COVID-19adult cases have been diagnosed with asthma. The number of asthma exacerbationsamong the study participants was higher during 2021 than in 2020 (p=0.035). Most of the included asthmatic participants (61.7%) were only positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 38.3% were co-infected with HRV. The SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold value waslower in samples infected with both viruses compared to samples infected withSARS-CoV-2 alone, p<0.005. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that HRV andSARS-CoV-2 were significantly more prevalent in asthma exacerbations than stable asthma. Thus, HRV and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections were potentially cofactors orcontributors to the asthma exacerbation in this cohort. This is the first study, in Jordan, to investigate the HRV co-infection in COVID-19 asthmatic patients andHRV could be related with a higher severity of COVID-19.

AB  - With the frequent detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) in dwellings and wastewater, the risk of transmission ofenvironmental contaminants is of great concern. Fast, simple and sensitivesensors are essential for timely detecting infection and controlling transmissionthrough environment fomites. Herein, we developed a Surface Enhanced RamanScattering (SERS) aptasensor, which can realize ultrasensitive and rapid assay ofSARS-CoV-2 viral particles. In this strategy, we designed a novel lockingamplifier which is activated only in the presence of virus by aptamerrecognition. The reaction process was carried out though one-pot method at 37degrees C, which can save time and resources. In addition, magnetic beads used inreaction system can simplify operation, as well as provide ideas for developingbiosensing robots via magnetic field. This SERS aptasensor can detect SARS-CoV-2 virus with a LOD of 260 TU/microL within 40 min in the linear range of 625-10000 TU/microL. Therefore, this convenience, speediness, sensitivity, and selectivity of detection has great prospects in analyzing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles or otherviruses in environment as well as monitoring of environmental virus sources.

TI  - Integrin-directed antibody-based immunotherapy: focus on VLA-4.
PG  - ltab002
LID - 10.1093/immadv/ltab002 [doi]
AB  - One major finding of chronic inflammatory diseases of various origins is theestablishment of inflammatory infiltrates, bearing different leukocytesubpopulations, including activated T lymphocytes. Integrins are among the large series of molecular interactions that have been implicated as players in bothtriggering and maintenance of leukocyte influx from the blood into a given organ parenchyme. Accordingly, blocking the interaction between VLA-6 integrin andlaminin, experimentally abrogates heart graft rejection. Many reports have shown that VLA-4 is used by T cells to cross endothelial barriers, as well as tomigrate within target tissues. In this respect, a humanized IgG4 anti-VLA-4monoclonal antibody (specific to the alpha4-integrin chain of VLA-4) has beensuccessfully applied to treat multiple sclerosis as well as inflammatory boweldisease. Anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody has also been applied to blocktransendothelial passage in other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoidarthritis. On this same vein is the action of such a reagent in impairing invitro transendothial and fibronectin-driven migration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) Tcells expressing high densities of VLA-4 from Duchenne muscular dystrophypatients, thus potentially enlarging the use of this strategy to other diseases. Yet, in a small number of patients, the use of Natalizumab has been correlatedwith the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a serious brain infectioncaused by the John Cunningham virus. This issue restricted the use of thereagent. In this respect, the development of smaller and more specific antibodyreagents should be envisioned as a next-generation promising strategy.

AB  - World Health Organization has defined COVID-19 as a contagious, communicable and fast spreading disease engendered by the Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, is arespirational microorganism. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan images of thechest helps in detecting COVID 19 infection in a fast way with much reliability. In this paper, chest CT scan images of COVID and Non-COVID categories areconsidered to train the supervised classifier, Iterative convolution NeuralNetwork. The training process is done with six different training data size. The trained models are iterated for the fixed size of testing data (20 images). Thesame set of training and testing processes are done with two different Iterative Convolutional Neural Network architectures, one with two hidden layers (CNN1) andanother with three hidden layers (CNN2). The iterations are extended up to 7, butthe model performance is degraded after the 6(th) iteration, which makes to fixthe iteration level as 5 for both CNN models. Six different training sets withfive iterations have led into 30 CNN models. For two different CNN architectures,which lead to 60 different models. The model designed with 100 training sets inboth CNN1 and CNN2, have produced the high accuracy in COVID classification than any other models. The better classification accuracy 89% is achieved from CNN2model with its 5(th) iteration.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges to humanity nowadays.COVID-19 virus can replicate in the host's larynx region, which is in contrast toother viruses that replicate in lungs only, i.e. SARS. This is conjectured tosupport a fast spread of COVID-19. However, there is sparse research in thisfield about quantitative comparison of virus load in the larynx for varyingsusceptible individuals. In this regard the lung geometry itself could influence the risk of reproducing more pathogens and consequently exhaling more virus.Disadvantageously, there are only sparse lung geometries available. To still beable to investigate realistic geometrical deviations we employ three differentdigital replicas of human airways up to the 7 th level of bifurcation,representing two realistic lungs (male and female) as well as a more simplifiedexperimental model. Our aim is to investigate the influence of breathingscenarios on aerosol deposition in anatomically different, realistic humanairways. In this context, we employ three levels of cardiovascular activity aswell as reported experimental particle size distributions by means ofComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with special focus on the larynx region toenable new insights into the local virus loads in human respiratory tracts. Inaddition, the influence of more realistic boundary conditions is investigated by performing transient simulations of a complete respiratory cycle in the upperlung regions of the considered respiratory models, focusing in particular ondeposition in the oral cavity, the laryngeal region, and trachea, whilesimplifying the tracheobronchial tree. The aerosol deposition is modeled viaOpenFOAM(\protect \relax \special {t4ht=(R)}) by employing an Euler-Lagrangianframe including steady and unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)resolved turbulent flow using the k- omega -SST and k- omega -SST DES turbulence models. We observed that the respiratory geometry altered the local depositionpatterns, especially in the laryngeal region. Despite the larynx region, theeffects of varying flow rate for the airway geometries considered were found tobe similar in the majority of respiratory tract regions. For all particle sizedistributions considered, localized particle accumulation occurred in the larynx of all considered lung models, which were more pronounced for larger particlesize distributions. Moreover, it was found, that employing transient simulations instead of steady-state analysis, the overall particle deposition pattern ismaintained, however with a stronger intensity in the transient cases.

AB  - In the bone marrow, plasma cells are made up of B lymphocytes and are a type ofWBC. These plasma cells produce antibodies that help to keep bacteria and virusesat bay, thus preventing inflammation. This presents a major challenge forsegmenting blood cells, since numerous image processing methods are used beforesegmentation to enhance image quality. White blood cells can be analyzed by apathologist with the aid of computer software to identify blood diseasesaccurately and early. This study proposes a novel model that uses the ResNet and UNet networks to extract features and then segments leukocytes from bloodsamples. Based on the experimental results, this model appears to perform well,which suggests it is an appropriate tool for the analysis of hematology data. By evaluating the model using three datasets consisting of three different types of WBC, a cross-validation technique was applied to assess it based on the publicly available dataset. The overall segmentation accuracy of the proposed model wasaround 96%, which proved that the model was better than previous approaches, suchas DeepLabV3+ and ResNet-50.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma is a significant global health challenge with steadilyincreasing incidence in the East Asia region. While both Hepatitis C and B virus infections account for the majority of HCC cases, the advent of potent antiviralsagainst HCV infection has biased the aetiology towards chronic HBV infection thatat the moment remains without an effective cure. For this reason, HBV-HCC remainsa persistent global problem. Treatment options for intermediate to advancedstages of HBV-HCC remain limited, hence novel therapeutic strategies are requiredto fulfil this medical need. Following the considerable success of adoptiveT-cell immunotherapy against B-cell malignancies, it is conceivable to envisionwhether the same could be achieved against HBV-HCC. In this review, we describethe development of T-cell therapy strategies for HBV-HCC and discuss the safetyand the efficacy of the strategies in terms of the direct killing of tumour cellsand the other alterations possibly induced by the action of the T cells.

TI  - Laboratory investigation of cases of fatal bacterial pneumonia in dairy cows.
PG  - 845-850
AB  - Objective: Bacterial bronchopneumonia occurs in mature dairy cows but much of theinformation is extrapolated from knowledge of the disease in calves. The studywas prompted by perceptions of an increasing occurrence and a paucity ofinformation on fatal Mannheimia haemolytica pneumonia in dairy cows in Ontario.The study objectives were to describe the seasonality, main pathogens involved,and suggested predisposing factors for cases of fatal bacterial bronchopneumonia in mature dairy cows submitted for postmortem examination to a diagnosticlaboratory, and to evaluate if the frequency of such submissions has increasedover time. Animals: Mature dairy cows. Procedure: Retrospective study of casessubmitted for postmortem examination to a diagnostic laboratory from 2007-2020that were diagnosed as bacterial bronchopneumonia. Results: Most of thepostmortem cases of bacterial bronchopneumonia in dairy cows were submitted from November to February (54% of cases). Mannheimia haemolytica was isolated fromlung of 61/101 cases. Viruses were only identified in 8/55 cases tested. Aminority (29/92) of bacterial isolates had in vitro resistance to antimicrobials used to treat pneumonia. Frequently suggested predisposing factors includedrecent introductions or movement of animals, recent or imminent calving,inclement weather, concurrent diseases, and poor ventilation in barns. Conclusionand clinical relevance: This study describes seasonal and annual trends, majorpathogens, antimicrobial resistance profiles, and suggested predisposing factors in Ontario dairy cows submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for postmorteminvestigation of pneumonia and provides insights for understanding why outbreaks occur.

AB  - We present a patient with untreated hepatitis C virus and metastatichepatocellular carcinoma treated with combination immunotherapy who developedelevated liver enzymes. The immunotherapy was withheld, and the liver enzymescontinued to rise. A liver biopsy was performed, which demonstrated findingsconsistent with chronic viral hepatitis. Direct-acting antiviral treatment wasinitiated, and the liver enzymes returned to normal limits. This casedemonstrates the diagnostic dilemmas raised among patients with hepatocellularcarcinoma on immunotherapy who develop elevated liver enzymes and some of thechallenges regarding the use of these medications in patients with viremichepatitis C virus.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of research and development in maintaining public health. Facing unprecedented challenges, the scientificcommunity developed antiviral drugs, virucides, and vaccines to combat theinfection within the past two years. However, an ever-increasing list of highlyinfectious SARS-CoV-2 variants (gamma, delta, omicron, and now ba.2 stealth) has exacerbated the problem: again raising the issues of infection preventionstrategies and the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE). Against this backdrop, we report an antimicrobial fabric for PPE applications. We havefabricated a nanofibrous silk-PEO material using electrospinning followed by zincoxide thin film deposition by employing the atomic layer deposition technique.The composite fabric has shown 85% more antibacterial activity than the controlfabric and was found to possess substantial superoxide dismutase-mimeticactivity. The composite was further subjected to antiviral testing using twodifferent respiratory tract viruses: coronavirus (OC43: enveloped) and rhinovirus(RV14: non-enveloped). We report a 95% reduction in infectious virus for bothOC43 and RV14 from an initial load of approximately 1 x 10(5) (sample size: 6 mm dia. disk), after 1 h of white light illumination. Furthermore, with 2 h ofillumination, approximately 99% reduction in viral infectivity was observed forRV14. High activity in a relatively small area of fabric (3.5 x 10(3) viral unitsper mm(2)) makes this antiviral fabric ideal for application in masks/PPE, withan enhanced ability to prevent antimicrobial infection overall.

TI  - Evolving Skin Rash as a Rare Cutaneous Manifestation in a Pediatric Patient With COVID-19 Infection.
PG  - e26477
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26477 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has been one of the common infections that have affected numerouschildren across the world in the last two years. The clinical manifestations ofthis virus are varied, ranging from being asymptomatic to affecting multipleorgan systems. There is a lot of ongoing research to find out the differentmanifestations that this infection can have in both adults and children. As with any viral illness, skin is one of the most commonly affected organs, and manyviral illnesses can present with a rash. In our case, we found it interestingthat our patient who tested positive for COVID-19 had a rash that began on theday of her initial presentation and evolved over time as the disease progressed, and hence, we thought it was important to highlight this rare case presentationas a cutaneous finding in children with COVID-19 infection.

TI  - The AAV-PCSK9 murine model of atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction.
PG  - oeac028
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac028 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Mouse models with genetic modifications are required to investigateatherogenesis and associated metabolic syndrome. Adeno-associated virus-8(AAV8)-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 (AAV8-PCSK9) induces hyperlipidaemia and promotes atherosclerosis in C57BL/6 mice. We aimed to assess whetherAAV8-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice fed high-fat diet with added cholesterol (HFD-C)would serve as a model of combined metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice received i.v. injection of AAV-PCSK9 and sex-and age-matched Ldlr(-/-) and C57BL/6 control mice were placed on HFD-C or chowdiet for 20 weeks (B6-PCSK9-HFD-C, Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C, B6-HFD-C, and B6-Chow,respectively). High-fat diet with added cholesterol feeding led to insulinresistance and impaired glucose clearance in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice compared withB6-Chow controls. This decrease in metabolic health in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice aswell as the development of atherosclerosis was similar to Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C mice.Importantly, HFD-C feeding induced pancreatic islet hyperplasia in B6-PCSK9-HFD-Cand B6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. In line with alterations in themetabolic phenotype, there was an increase in the number of pro-inflammatoryLy6C(high/med) monocytes within the adipose tissues of B6-PCSK9-HFD-C andB6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. Conclusion: High-fat diet with addedcholesterol-fed AAV-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice can serve as a useful model ofintegrated metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis that does not require geneticmanipulations.

AB  - In Cote d'Ivoire, a country of 28 million inhabitants in West Africa, a surveyconducted by the Ministry of the Family in 2018 showed the extent of gender-basedviolence (GBV) in the Greater Abidjan area (5 million inhabitants), the country'seconomic capital. The social workers employed for this work were mobilized duringthe Covid-19 pandemic to raise awareness and help the population fight againstSARS-CoV-2. The results collected by these workers during the first period(January 2019 - February 2020) and the second period (March 2020 - April 2021)are the subject of this article.From the first period to the second, the numberof rapes increased from 41 to 77, sexual assaults from 4 to 7, physical assaults from 139 to 171, and forced marriages from 4 to 7. In total, the social workershelped 303 victims during the pre-pandemic period and 402 during the pandemic.This evolution varies from municipality to municipality in the Greater Abidjanarea, and is not related to the number of inhabitants per municipality andwithout any link with the frequency of Covid-19 in each municipality. Despitepossible biases, this study highlights a major health problem, GBV, anddemonstrates the probable negative effects of the pandemic.

TI  - The Impact of the Highly Virulent SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant on Young Adults in theState of Sao Paulo: Was It Inevitable?
PG  - e26486
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26486 [doi]
AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had and is stillhaving a tremendous impact on people all over the world, but it has beenparticularly harsh in South America. Nine out of 13 South American countries are among the 50 countries with the highest COVID-19 death rates. The gamma severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant that emerged by theend of 2020 in the Brazilian Amazon quickly spread throughout the country causingthe harsh COVID-19 second wave. This variant displayed high viral loads, hightransmissibility, and increased virulence as compared to previous variants. Aims The aim of this retrospective study is to revisit and analyse the epidemiology ofthe COVID-19 second wave in the state of Sao Paulo, the most populous Brazilianstate. In addition to examining the possible factors that led to the emergenceand propagation of the gamma variant, measures that could have prevented itsspread and that of other highly virulent variants were also investigated.Materials and methods Data from Sao Paulo's official sources on morbidity,mortality, age distribution, and testing prior to and during the COVID-19 second wave (February - June 2021) and data regarding the distribution of SARS-CoV-2variants in the country were parsed, analyzed, and compared to the period thatanteceded the eruption of the second COVID-19 wave. Results In the state of SaoPaulo, the toll of the COVID-19 second wave surpassed that of the first 11 monthsof the pandemic (from March 2020 to January 2021), as 56% of the deaths occurred in the five months of the second wave between February and June 2021. The meanage of COVID-19 victims, which was already below life expectancy in the statedropped even further in the pandemic's second wave, reaching an average of 60years of age. The years of life lost per death per month doubled and thecase-fatality rate (CFR) of young adults (20-39 years old) more than trebledduring this period. A number of hypotheses have been raised that might explainthe emergence and spread of the gamma variant and the measures that could havebeen taken to prevent it and minimise its impact on the population. ConclusionsOver 142,000 people died as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant sweep in SaoPaulo in the first semester of 2021. Due to its high viral load, the gammavariant displayed high transmissibility and a high degree of virulence resulting in increased case fatality rates across most age tiers. Notably, this second wavewas marked by a very significant increase in deaths among young adults. Thisincrease was at least partially due to a deterioration in general health provokedby non-pharmaceutical interventions. In hindsight, a safer and more effectivemeasure might have been to allow the free spread of the virus among the young andhealthy in the first wave, thus conferring immunity against more virulentvariants that emerged later on.

TI  - Tuberculosis and Its "Troubled Relationship" With Other Diseases.
PG  - e26482
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26482 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a multisystemic disease caused most frequently byMycobacterium tuberculosis. Extrapulmonary TB has become more frequent with theadvent of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as HIV can facilitate the infection with M. tuberculosis, especially during HIV seroconversion. Here, we present the case of a 22-year-old man, from Guinea-Bissau, with a history of untreated HIVwho was admitted to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure needingmechanical ventilation. Pulmonary TB was diagnosed. His stay was complicated witha hemorrhagic shock due to traumatic urethral catheterization, which led to aperforation of the capsule of the prostate. A prostatectomy was needed forbleeding control. The anatomopathological examination confirmed the presence ofacid-resistant bacilli, and an extensive caseous type necrosis of the wholetissue, thus diagnosing a prostatic tuberculosis. The patient recovered after ahemorrhagic shock, a urologic and radical intervention, and some severeinfectious complications.

AB  - Background: Globally, India is the country with the highest tuberculosis (TB)burden with respect to the number of new cases occurring each year. Annualincident cases of TB in India accounts for more than 25% of total TB morbidityand mortality worldwide. Several factors have been associated with the adherence of TB medication, which can be broadly classified as patient/personal, social,structural and health service. The aims of the present study were to determinethe compliance to daily regimen of directly observed treatment, short-course(DOTS) therapy among TB patients registered at the Tuberculosis Unit (TU) ofMangalore and to identify the factors influencing non-compliance for treatment.Methods: A cross sectional study was performed. The study sample was drawn fromthe TUs, General Hospital, Mangalore, after taking permission from District TBOfficer. The names and addresses of TB patients were collected from treatmentcards. The TB patients were approached at their homes/DOTS centers/Primary HealthCentre's (PHCs) with the help of senior treatment supervisors. Results: It wasfound that patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were morelikely to be non-adherent, which was statistically significant. Amongst theparticipants, 66 (33%) were diabetic and 28.8% of them were found to benon-adherent. The proportion of non-adherence was 27 times higher in those withpoor patient provider relationships. Patients who reported to have side effectsof TB medication were 5.23 times more likely to be non-adherent. Conclusions:Advice on routine consultation with the health care facility, adherence totreatment regimen and education about its benefits should be the prime focus ofproviding health education to all TB patients, both at the individual andcommunity levels.

AB  - Background: Effective measures to control COVID-19 should be based on anunderstanding of its epidemiological pattern and the evaluation of its prevalencein the community. This study aimed to examine the reproductive number (R) ofCOVID-19 and its trend in Fars Province in southern Iran. Methods: In thisecological study, the R trend was examined from July to November 2020. Data were collected from the daily reports of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. R isthe product of three components, namely the number of infection-producingcontacts per unit time, the probability of transmission per contact, and thecontagiousness period. Incidence and prevalence rates were used to calculate R.The R value was calculated in Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: The first and secondpeaks of COVID-19 were observed on July 6(th) and November 22(nd), respectively. The median and mean of R were 1.42 and 1.41, respectively. The highest and lowestvalues of R were observed on October 20(th) (2.60) and September 1(st) (0.46),respectively. The values of R had a slightly decreasing trend in the second half of July and November than the first half. In the second half of August andSeptember, an increasing trend was observed than the first half. There was notmuch change in the second half of October. Conclusion: The highest value of R wasrelated to the dates when there was a higher probability of exposure to thevirus, including public holidays and different occasions on which the probabilityof people's participation in ceremonies, communities, and gatherings was higher.

AB  - For a while, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been a major globalpandemic. It primarily affects the respiratory system but has extrapulmonarymanifestations such as gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Data onmyasthenia gravis (MG), as a complication of COVID-19, are limited. We hereinreport the manifestation of ocular MG as an initial symptom of COVID-19. InNovember 2020, a 31-year-old healthy woman was referred to Firoozgar Hospital(Tehran, Iran) with left upper eyelid ptosis and diplopia as well as generalweakness, myalgia, fever, and nasal congestion for four days prior to admission. Although the acetylcholine receptor antibody in her serum was negative, increasedjitter in several muscles led to the diagnosis of ocular MG. Nasal swab reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay tested positive for severeacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Computedtomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities andsome foci of consolidation formation, but the thymus was normal. The patient was successfully treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. The patient waseventually discharged in good condition and with improved neurological symptoms. A limited number of studies have suggested a possible association between MG and COVID-19. Therefore, further data are required to substantiate the proposedassociation. Clinicians should be aware of ocular MG during the COVID-19 pandemicto better diagnose and manage patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - In December 2019, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak emerged inWuhan, China. The World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Reports indicated that the associated mortality of the infection is quite higher in the elderly, individuals with specific comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus), and generally the ones with a compromised immune system. Acohort study in Wuhan, China, reported a dysregulated immune response in 452patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. As a result of this suppressedimmune response, an increase in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, T lymphopenia,and a decrease in CD4(+) T cells were all common laboratory findings, especially in severe cases. On the other hand, there is substantial evidence of T cellexhaustion in critically ill patients. Accordingly, the immune system seems toplay an important role in the prognosis and pathogenesis of the disease.Therefore, this study aims to review the evidence on the immune responsedysregulation in COVID-19 infection and the potential role of immunoregulatorytreatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, interferons, and CD200inhibitors in altering disease prognosis, especially in critically ill patients.

AB  - This report shows a case of corneal transplant rejection after vaccinationagainst severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), short afterreceiving the BNT162b2 vaccine, in a patient who had undergone keratoplasty more than 20 years ago, with no previous episodes of rejection and no other factorthat could lead to the findings on his examinations. After treatment with highdoses of topic, oral, and sub-conjunctival corticoids, the patient had afavorable therapeutic response. The signs of corneal transplant rejection must beoriented to the patients and the causing factors actively searched byophthalmologists so that treatment is rapidly initiated and sequels are avoided. This report raises the question if these events are correlated and whether thepatient should receive the second dose of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 or not.

AB  - Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2), a virulent and contagious viralpathogen that affects wild and domestic lagomorph populations, was identified in Wyoming, USA in December 2020. A surveillance program was developed involvingfull-carcass submission and liver analysis, although carcass quality as a result of predation and decomposition impeded analysis. To increase the number ofsubmissions and provide flexibility to field staff, we evaluated 2 sample types: 77 dried blood on filter paper samples, 66 ear punch samples. At initialsampling, test specificity and sensitivity of the RT-rtPCR utilizing dried blood on filter paper and ear punch samples were both 100% compared to liver. Filterpaper results were consistent over time; sensitivity stayed >96% through weeks 2,4, and 6, with a maximum mean difference of 6.0 Ct from baseline liver Ct values (95% CI: 5.0-7.3) at 6 wk. Test sensitivity of the ear punch sample at 1, 3, 5,and 7 wk post-sampling remained at 100%, with a maximum mean difference of 5.6 Ctfrom baseline liver Ct values (95% CI: 4.3-6.9) at 5 wk. Filter paper and earpunch samples were suitable alternatives to liver for RHDV2 surveillance in wild lagomorph populations. Alternative sampling options provide more flexibility tosurveillance programs, increase testable submissions, and decrease exposure offield personnel to zoonotic disease agents.

TI  - Understanding the barriers and facilitators to using self-sampling packs forsexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses: Thematic analyses forintervention optimization.
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12617 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Self-sampling packs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) andblood-borne viruses (BBVs) are widely offered. There are ongoing problems withreach and sample return rates. The packs have arisen without formal intervention development. This paper illustrates initial steps of an intervention optimizationprocess to improve the packs. METHODS: Eleven focus groups and seven interviewswere conducted with convenience samples of patients recruited from sexual health clinics and members of the public (n = 56). To enable intervention optimization, firstly, we conducted an inductive appraisal of the behavioural system of usingthe pack to understand meaningful constituent behavioural domains. Subsequently, we conducted a thematic analysis of barriers and facilitators to enacting eachsequential behavioural domain in preparation for future behaviour change wheelanalysis. RESULTS: Overall, we found that self-sampling packs were acceptable.Participants understood their overall logic and value as a pragmatic interventionthat simultaneously facilitated and reduced barriers to individuals being tested for STIs and BBVs. However, at the level of each behavioural domain (e.g.,reading leaflets, returning samples) problems with the pack were identified, aswell as a series of potential optimizations, which might widen the reach ofself-sampling and increase the return of viable samples. CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides an example of a pragmatic approach to optimizing an intervention alreadywidely offered globally. The paper demonstrates the added value healthpsychological approaches offer; conceptualizing interventions in behaviouralterms, pinpointing granular behavioural problems amenable for systematic further improvement.

LID - 10.12659/AJCR.936862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LyG) is a rare lymphoproliferativedisorder associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in which there is an infection of B cells and numerous reactive T cells. The lymphoproliferative disorderprogresses to organ infiltration and resultant dysfunction of affected organs.Histologically, it is characterized by a triad of polymorphic lymphoidinfiltrate, angiitis, and granulomatosis. The lungs are the most commonlyinvolved sites for lymphomatoid granulomatosis, but other sites that can beinvolved include the liver, skin, and central nervous system. The signs andsymptoms of LyG can vary, and can produce generalized symptoms such as cough,shortness of breath, and chest tightness, but can vary depending on the location of LyG. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 60-year-old man who presented withaltered mental status. Cross-sectional imaging of the brain was negative for any acute intracranial process, but a fine-needle biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymphnode revealed nodular polymorphous mononuclear infiltrates containing atypicallarge EBV-positive B cells with positive EBER and CD30, consistent withlymphomatoid granulomatosis. The patient was started on a regimen ofbrentuximab/bendamustine, and instructed to follow up with Oncology on anoutpatient basis. CONCLUSIONS Treatment options for lymphomatoid granulomatosisare based on the disease grading. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis can be classifiedby using a grading system determined by the number of EBV-positive large B cellmalignant cells, along with necrosis. The most effective treatment forlymphomatoid granulomatosis is unknown, but at this time treatment protocols are based on the grade of the disease. The clinical and histological features oflymphomatoid granulomatosis are discussed in this case report.

TI  - PEDOT:PSS in Solution Form Exhibits Strong Potential in Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2Infection of the Host Cells by Targeting Viruses and Also the Host Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00271 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic with over 5 million fatalities. Vaccines against this virus have beenglobally administered; however, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations are continuously identified with strong capability to escape vaccine-elicitedprotection. Due to the high mutation rate and transmission ability, thedevelopment of a broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor is highly in demand. In thisstudy, the effect of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS) against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated. The treatment of pseudovirusescarrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with PEDOT:PSS strongly blocked SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in human ACE2-expressing cells without causingcytotoxicity. Specifically, PEDOT:PSS showed great potential in both inactivatingviruses and rendering antiviral activity to the treated cells. The effects ofother PEDOT:PSS solutions with different chemical ratios and properties were alsovalidated to find the high inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirusinfection. The transcriptomic data reveal that PEDOT:PSS-treated cells wereendowed with transcriptional alteration, and it could be reverted after theremoval of PEDOT:PSS from the culture medium. Importantly, PEDOT:PSS alsoexhibited broad-spectrum inhibition effects on the pseudovirus carrying the spikeprotein isolated from different variants. In combination with the advantage ofhigh biocompatibility, PEDOT:PSS could thus be considered a potential therapeuticand prophylactic material against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and seasonality of acute respiratoryinfection associated with single and co-detected rhinovirus species amonghospitalized children in Amman, Jordan.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus (RV)-specific surveillance studies in the Middle East are limited. Therefore, we aimed to study the clinical characteristics, outcomes, andseasonality of RV-associated acute respiratory infection among hospitalized youngchildren in Jordan. METHODS: We conducted a prospective viral surveillance study and enrolled children <2 years old admitted to a large public hospital in Amman, Jordan (2010-2013). Demographic and clinical data were collected by structuredinterviews and chart abstractions. Nasal and/or throat swabs were collected andtested for a panel of respiratory viruses, and RV genotyping and speciation wasperformed. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 2,641/3,168 children(83.4%). RV was the second most common virus detected (n=1,238; 46.9%) and wasco-detected with another respiratory virus in 730 cases (59.0%). Children with RVco-detection were more likely than those with RV-only detection to haverespiratory distress but had similar outcomes. RV-A accounted for about half ofRV-positive cases (54.7%), while children with RV-C had a higher frequency ofwheezing and reactive airway disease. RV was detected year-round and peakedduring winter. CONCLUSIONS: Though children with RV co-detection had worseclinical findings, neither co-detection nor species affected most clinicaloutcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

LID - 10.1186/s13578-022-00859-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a disease affecting the centralnervous system. Over the last decade, the incidence of TBE has steadily increasedin Europe and Asia despite the availably of effective vaccines. Up to 50% ofpatients after TBE suffer from post-encephalitic syndrome that may develop intolong-lasting morbidity. Altered sleep-wake functions have been reported bypatients after TBE. The mechanisms causing these disorders in TBE are largelyunknown to date. As a first step toward a better understanding of the pathologyof TBEV-inducing sleep dysfunctions, we assessed parameters of sleep structure inan established infant rat model of TBE. METHODS: 13-day old Wistar rats wereinfected with 1 x 10(6) FFU Langat virus (LGTV). On day 4, 9, and 21 postinfection, Rotarod (balance and motor coordination) and open field tests (generallocomotor activity) were performed and brains from representative animals werecollected in each subgroup. On day 28 the animals were implanted with atelemetric EEG/EMG system. Sleep recording was continuously performed for 24consecutive hours starting at day 38 post infection and visually scored for Wake,NREM, and REM in 4 s epochs. RESULTS: As a novelty of this study, infectedanimals showed a significant larger percentage of time spend awake during thedark phase and less NREM and REM compared to the control animals (p < 0.01 forall comparisons). Furthermore, it was seen, that during the dark phase the wakebout length in infected animals was prolonged (p = 0.043) and the fragmentationindex decreased (p = 0.0085) in comparison to the control animals. LGTV-infected animals additionally showed a reduced rotarod performance ability at day 4 (p =0.0011) and day 9 (p = 0.0055) and day 21 (p = 0.0037). A lower locomotoractivity was also seen at day 4 (p = 0.0196) and day 9 (p = 0.0473). CONCLUSION: Our data show that experimental TBE in infant rats affects sleep-wake behavior,leads to decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, and impaired moto-coordinativefunction.

TI  - Fantastic perspectives and where to find them: involving patients and citizens indigital health research.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s40900-022-00374-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital contact tracing and exposure notification apps have quicklyemerged as a potential solution to achieve timely and effective contact tracingfor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nonetheless, their actual uptake remains limited.Citizens, including patients, are rarely consulted and included in the design andimplementation process. Their contribution supports the acceptability of suchapps, by providing upstream evidence on incentives and potential barriers thatare most relevant to users. The DIGICIT (DIGITal CITizenship) project relied onpatient and citizen partnership in research to better integrate publicperspectives on these apps. In this paper, we present the co-construction processthat led to the survey instrument used in the DIGICIT project and theinterpretation of its results. This approach promotes public participation inresearch on contact tracing and exposure notification apps, as well as relateddigital health applications. OBJECTIVES: This article has three objectives: (1)describe the methodological process to co-construct a questionnaire and interpretthe survey results with patients and citizens, (2) assess their experiencesregarding this methodology, and (3) propose best practices for their involvement in digital health research. METHODS: The DIGICIT project was developed in foursteps: (1) creation of the advisory committee composed of patients and citizens, (2) co-construction of a questionnaire, (3) interpretation of survey results, and(4) assessment of the experience of committee participants. RESULTS: Of the 25applications received for participation in the advisory committee, we selected 12people based on pre-established diversity criteria. Participants initiallygenerated 84 survey questions in the first co-construction meeting, andeventually selected 36 in the final version. Participants made more than 20recommendations when interpreting survey results and suggested carrying out focusgroups with marginalized populations to increase representativity. Theyappreciated their inclusion early in the research process, being listened to and respected, the collective intelligence, and the method used for integrating theirsuggestions. They suggested that the study objectives and roles be betterdefined, that more time in the brainstorming sessions be allowed, and thatdiscussion outside of meetings be encouraged. CONCLUSION: Having patients andcitizens actively participating in this research constitutes the mainmethodological strength. They enriched the study from start to finish, andrecommended the addition of focus groups to seek the perspective of marginalized groups that are typically under-represented from digital health research. Clearcommunication of the project objectives, good organization in meetings, andcontinuous evaluation from participants allow best practices to be achieved forpatients' and citizens' involvement in digital health research. Co-constructionin research generates critical study design ideas through collectiveintelligence. This methodology can be used in various clinical contexts anddifferent healthcare settings.

OAB - COVID Alert is a mobile application (app) that was developed created to helplimit the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Although promising, these apps have notbeen widely used by the population, in part due to limited citizen engagement in their design. The DIGICIT project (DIGITal CITizenship) was carried out inpartnership with citizens, including patients, to gather public perspective inQuebec, Canada about the COVID Alert app. The purpose of this article is todescribe our method of constructing a survey questionnaire with patients andcitizens. We have created an advisory committee of 12 participants. Along withthe research team, they created a 36-question survey. They also suggested doingfocus groups to add data to the survey by reaching marginalized groups that aretraditionally excluded from digital health research. We also wanted to know theexperience of the participants being included in this study. We conductedinterviews and did a small survey with them. They appreciated being included fromthe beginning of the research, being listened to, and being respected. Theyappreciated the creativity of the group and the brainstorming sessions. However, they would have liked the tasks to be clearer from the start. They also wouldhave preferred to have more time in the brainstorming sessions to create thesurvey questions, and to have discussions outside of the meetings. The inclusion of patients and citizens is the main strength of this project. To improve theirintegration in health research, there needs to be good communication of projectobjectives. Also, meetings must be well organized, and participants must be able to evaluate their experience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mid-term respiratory sequelae in survivors of severe COVID-19appear highly heterogeneous. In addition, factors associated with respiratorysequelae are not known. In this monocentric prospective study, we performed amultidisciplinary assessment for respiratory and muscular impairment andpsychological distress 3 months after severe COVID-19. We analysed factorsassociated with severe persistent respiratory impairment, amongst demographic,COVID-19 severity, and 3-month assessment. METHODS: Patients with severeSARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring >/= 4L/min were included for a systematic 3-month visit, including respiratory assessment (symptoms, lung function, CT scan),muscular evaluation (body composition, physical function and activity,disability), psychopathological evaluation (anxiety, depression, post-traumaticstress disorder-PTSD) and quality of life. A cluster analysis was performed toidentify subgroups of patients based on objective functional measurements: DLCO, total lung capacity and 6-min walking distance (6MWD). RESULTS: Sixty-twopatients were analysed, 39% had dyspnea on exercise (mMRC >/= 2), 72% had DLCO < 80%, 90% had CT-scan abnormalities; 40% had sarcopenia/pre-sarcopenia and 31% hadsymptoms of PTSD. Cluster analysis identified a group of patients (n = 18, 30.5%)with a severe persistent (SP) respiratory impairment (DLCO 48 +/- 12%, 6MWD 299+/- 141 m). This SP cluster was characterized by older age, severe respiratorysymptoms, but also sarcopenia/pre-sarcopenia, symptoms of PTSD and markedlyimpaired quality of life. It was not associated with initial COVID-19 severity ormanagement. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATION: We identified a phenotype ofpatients with severe persistent respiratory and muscular impairment andpsychological distress 3 months after severe COVID-19. Our results highlight the need for multidisciplinary assessment and management after severe SARS-CoV-2pneumonia. Trial registration The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (May6, 2020): NCT04376840.

TI  - Multiple roles of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B(APOBEC3B) in human tumors: a pan-cancer analysis.
PG  - 312
LID - 10.1186/s12859-022-04862-0 [doi]
AB  - Although there have been some recent cell and animal experiments indicating that expression of the gene encoding apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalyticsubunit 3B (APOBEC3B) is closely related to cancer, it still lacks pan-canceranalysis. Here we analyzed the potential carcinogenic role of APOBEC3B in 33tumors based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). APOBEC3B was highly expressed in most tumors and weakly expressed in a few. Differences in expression level weresignificantly correlated with the pathological tumor stage and prognosis ofaffected patients. The high-frequency APOBEC3B changes were principally mutationsand amplifications in some tumors, such as uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas or cutaneous melanomas. In testicular germ cell tumors and invasive breastcarcinomas, APOBEC3B expression and CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts were correlated.In other cancers, such as human papilloma virus (HPV)-related head and necksquamous cell carcinomas or esophageal adenocarcinomas, there was alsocancer-associated fibroblast infiltration. The APOBEC3B enzyme acts in themitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain and in oxidativephosphorylation. This first pan-cancer study provides a comprehensiveunderstanding of the multiple roles of APOBEC3B in different tumor types.

PG  - 311
LID - 10.1186/s12859-022-04784-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting women and is caused by human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections that are sexually transmitted.There are currently commercially available prophylactic vaccines that have beenshown to protect vaccinated individuals against HPV infections, however, thesevaccines have no therapeutic effects for those who are previously infected withthe virus. The current study's aim was to use immunoinformatics to develop amulti-epitope vaccine with therapeutic potential against cervical cancer.RESULTS: In this study, T-cell epitopes from E5 and E7 proteins of HPV16/18 were predicted. These epitopes were evaluated and chosen based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and induction of IFN-gamma production (only in helper T lymphocytes). Then, the selected epitopes were sequentially linked by appropriatelinkers. In addition, a C-terminal fragment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis heatshock protein 70 (HSP70) was used as an adjuvant for the vaccine construct. Thephysicochemical parameters of the vaccine construct were acceptable. Furthermore,the vaccine was soluble, highly antigenic, and non-allergenic. The vaccine's 3Dmodel was predicted, and the structural improvement after refinement wasconfirmed using the Ramachandran plot and ProSA-web. The vaccine's B-cellepitopes were predicted. Molecular docking analysis showed that the vaccine'srefined 3D model had a strong interaction with the Toll-like receptor 4. Thestructural stability of the vaccine construct was confirmed by molecular dynamicssimulation. Codon adaptation was performed in order to achieve efficient vaccine expression in Escherichia coli strain K12 (E. coli). Subsequently, in silicocloning of the multi-epitope vaccine was conducted into pET-28a ( +) expressionvector. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of bioinformatics analyses, themulti-epitope vaccine is structurally stable, as well as a non-allergic andnon-toxic antigen. However, in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validatethe vaccine's efficacy and safety. If satisfactory results are obtained from invitro and in vivo studies, the vaccine designed in this study may be effective asa therapeutic vaccine against cervical cancer.

TI  - Molecular characterization of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus isolated in Chilereveals several mutations in VP2 coding region and a reassortment in its genome.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09956-x [doi]
AB  - Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) is a well-described disease in young chickens. Itis caused by the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV), which has abi-segmented, double-strand RNA genome. The absence of a lipidic envelope makesIBDV highly resistant to environmental conditions. Consequently, it is widelyreported around the world. Fourteen samples retrieved from chickens exhibitingapparent alterations of the bursa of Fabricius between 2017 and 2021 wereincluded in the study. These samples were passaged into embryonated eggs and the presence of IBD was confirmed through RT-PCR. The PCR products were sequenced andanalyzed to characterize the Chilean IBDV isolates for comparison with GenBanksequences, including vaccines sequences currently used in Chile.Phylogeneticanalysis classified the Chilean sequences as A1B1, except the sample15002_CL_2021 which was classified as A2B1. On the other hand, all Chileanviruses were grouped as B1, based on viral segment B. Estimated evolutionarydivergence between different genogroups supports these clustering. Moreover,samples 13936_CL_2017, 14038_CL_2017, 14083_CL_2017, 14145_CL_2018,14431_CL_2019, and 14459_CL_2019 showed high similitude with the D78 and ViBursa CE vaccines (both currently used in Chile). Viruses 14010_CL_2018, 14040_CL_2017,14514_CL_2019 and 14019_CL_2017 exhibited patterns that do not exactly fit eithervaccine. Finally, viruses 15,041 N-_CL_2021, 15,041 N+_CL_2021, and 15004_CL_2021showed even more differences regarding both vaccines.This is the first study inChile to analyze the genetic sequences of IBDV isolates. The differentassessments conducted as part of the study suggest a close relationship withvaccines currently in use. Interestingly, one of the viruses exhibited areassortment in its genome segments, which could confer new characteristics tothe virus. However, new approaches would be required to establish the origin ofthe isolated viruses, as well as how the recombination is changing its virulence or morbidity.

PG  - 13264
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17058-6 [doi]
AB  - PILRA (rs1859788 A > G) has been suggested to be a protective variant forAlzheimer's disease (AD) and is an entry co-receptor for herpes simplex virus-1. We conducted a nested case-control study of 360 1:1-matched AD subjects.Interactions between the PILRA-A allele, APOE risk variants (epsilon3/epsilon4 orepsilon4/epsilon4) and GM17 for AD risk were modelled. The associations werecross-validated using two independent whole-genome sequencing datasets. We found negative interactions between PILRA-A and GM17 (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-1.00) andbetween PILRA-A and APOE risk variants (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.98) in thediscovery dataset. In the replication cohort, a joint effect of PILRA and PILRA xGM 17/17 was observed for the risk of developing AD (p .02). Here, we report anegative effect modification by PILRA on APOE and GM17 high-risk variants forfuture AD risk in two independent datasets. This highlights the complex genetics of AD.

AB  - The mammalian virome has been linked to health and disease but our understanding of how it is structured along the longitudinal axis of the mammaliangastrointestinal tract (GIT) and other organs is limited. Here, we report ametagenomic analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic virome occupying luminaland mucosa-associated habitats along the GIT, as well as parenchymal organs(liver, lung and spleen), in two representative mammalian species, the domesticpig and rhesus macaque (six animals per species). Luminal samples from the large intestine of both mammals harboured the highest loads and diversity ofbacteriophages (class Caudoviricetes, family Microviridae and others). Mucosalsamples contained much lower viral loads but a higher proportion of eukaryoticviruses (families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae). Parenchymal organs contained bacteriophages of gut origin, in addition to some eukaryotic viruses.Overall, GIT virome composition was specific to anatomical region and hostspecies. Upper GIT and mucosa-specific viruses were greatly under-represented in distal colon samples (a proxy for faeces). Nonetheless, certain viral and phagespecies were ubiquitous in all samples from the oral cavity to the distal colon. The dataset and its accompanying methodology may provide an important resourcefor future work investigating the biogeography of the mammalian gut virome.

AB  - Pangolins are the most trafficked wild animal in the world according to the WorldWildlife Fund. The discovery of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayanpangolins has piqued interest in the viromes of these wild, scaly-skinnedmammals. We sequenced the viromes of 161 pangolins that were smuggled into China and assembled 28 vertebrate-associated viruses, 21 of which have not beenpreviously reported in vertebrates. We named 16 members of Hunnivirus, Pestivirusand Copiparvovirus pangolin-associated viruses. We report that the L-protein has been lost from all hunniviruses identified in pangolins. Sequences of fourhuman-associated viruses were detected in pangolin viromes, including respiratorysyncytial virus, Orthopneumovirus, Rotavirus A and Mammalian orthoreovirus. Thegenomic sequences of five mammal-associated and three tick-associated viruseswere also present. Notably, a coronavirus related to HKU4-CoV, which wasoriginally found in bats, was identified. The presence of these viruses insmuggled pangolins identifies these mammals as a potential source of emergentpathogenic viruses.

AB  - Immersive ultraviolet disinfection provides a chemical-free technology for safer textiles, surfaces, and public spaces by inactivating communicable pathogens.This study examined immersive UV disinfection, using a disinfection cabinet, ofE. coli and MS2 that was inoculated on white cotton T-shirts. The impact thatporous materials have on UV disinfection is poorly understood with the majorityof previous surface disinfection research focusing on hard, smooth surfaces.Several approaches were used in this study to characterize the light dynamicswithin the disinfection cabinet including colorimetric dosimetry coupons,biodosimetry, and spectroradiometry. Micro and macro geometry of porous surfaces are important factors to consider when using immersive UV technologies. Thegeometry of the cabinet impacted the distribution of emitted UV light within the disinfection cabinet and the physical properties of a porous material, such asthe woven pattern of cotton, both contribute to UV disinfection efficiency. This work identified that light distribution is crucial for immersive UV technologies as the delivered fluence was highly variable within the disinfection cabinet and resulted in a difference of several logs of reduction for adjacent areas ofT-shirt samples. Other inoculated areas achieved upwards of 1-log reductionsvalues for MS2 and upwards of 2-log reductions for E. coli.

AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can damage soft tissuesand supporting teeth. Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen usually living in the oral cavity and plays a critical role in apical periodontitis that significantly threatens human health. The use of bacteriophages as an alternativeway to eliminate bacterial infections is a promising approach. E. faecalis wasisolated from the depth of dental packets of patients with periodontitis.Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using 16 antimicrobial agents. Also, aspecific virulent bacteriophage (vB_EfaS-SRH2) with an irregular pentagonalmorphology of the head and a non-contractile tail belonging to the Siphoviridae, was isolated from wastewater in East of Isfahan, Iran, and its physiological and genomic specifications were investigated. The genome was double-strand DNA with38,746 bp length and encoded 62 putative ORFs. In addition, eight Anti-CRISPERsand 30 Rho-dependent terminators were found. No tRNA was found. It had a shortlatent period of 15 min and a large burst size of ~ 125. No undesirable genes(antibiotic resistance, lysogenic dependence, and virulence factors) wereidentified in the genome. Based on physiological properties and genomiccharacteristics, this phage can be used as a suitable choice in phage therapy forperiodontitis and root canal infection.

TI  - Understanding hesitancy with revealed preferences across COVID-19 vaccine types.
PG  - 13293
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15633-5 [doi]
AB  - Many countries have secured larger quantities of COVID-19 vaccines than theirpopulation is willing to take. The abundance and the large variety of vaccinescreated not only an unprecedented intensity of vaccine related public discourse, but also a historical moment to understand vaccine hesitancy better. Yet, theheterogeneity of hesitancy by vaccine types has been neglected in the existingliterature so far. We address this problem by analysing the acceptance and theassessment of five vaccine types. We use information collected with a nationally representative survey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic inHungary. During the vaccination campaign, individuals could reject the assignedvaccine to wait for a more preferred alternative that enables us to quantifyrevealed preferences across vaccine types. We find that hesitancy is heterogenousby vaccine types and is driven by individuals' trusted source of information.Believers of conspiracy theories are more likely to evaluate the mRNA vaccines(Pfizer and Moderna) unacceptable. Those who follow the advice of politicians aremore likely to evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or whole-virusvaccines (Sinopharm) acceptable. We argue that the greater selection of availablevaccine types and the free choice of the individual are desirable conditions toincrease the vaccination rate in societies.

AB  - The study aims to determine the selected miRNAs expression in milk somatic cells (MSC) and blood leukocytes (BL) of SRLV-seronegative (SRLV-SN) andSRLV-seropositive (SRLV-SP) goats. A functional in silico analysis of theirtarget genes was also conducted. MiR-93-5p and miR-30e-5p were expressed only in BL, while miR-144 was expressed only in MSC, regardless of SRLV infection. In theSRLV-SP goats, higher miR-214-3p and miR-221-5p levels were found in the MSC thanin the BL. Only miR-30e-5p was influenced by the lactation stage in BL in bothgroups, while only miR-93-5p was altered in BL of SRLV-SN goats. The target gene protein products exhibited contradictory functions, protecting the host fromvirus on the one hand and assisting viruses in their life cycle on the other. Thedifferential expression of the miRNAs observed between the MSC and BL of SRLV-SP goats may suggest that the local immune response to the infection in the udderdiffers from the systemic response, and acts independently. Some miRNAsdemonstrated different expression between lactation stages. It may be influenced by the metabolic burden occurring in early lactation and its peak. Some of thestudied miRNAs may influence viral infection by regulating the expression oftheir target genes.

AB  - First identified in 1947, Zika virus took roughly 70 years to cause a pandemicunusually associated with virus-induced brain damage in newborns. Zika virus istransmitted by mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti, and secondarily, Aedesalbopictus, both colonizing a large strip encompassing tropical and temperateregions. As part of the international project ZIKAlliance initiated in 2016, 50mosquito populations from six species collected in 12 countries wereexperimentally infected with different Zika viruses. Here, we show that Ae.aegypti is mainly responsible for Zika virus transmission having the highestsusceptibility to viral infections. Other species play a secondary role intransmission while Culex mosquitoes are largely non-susceptible. Zika strain isexpected to significantly modulate transmission efficiency with African strainsbeing more likely to cause an outbreak. As the distribution of Ae. aegypti willdoubtless expand with climate change and without new marketed vaccines, all theingredients are in place to relive a new pandemic of Zika.

AB  - REGEN-COV, a combination of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, has been approved as a treatment for high-risk patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 within five days of their diagnosis. We performed a retrospective cohort study,and used data repositories of Israel's largest healthcare organization todetermine the real-world effectiveness of REGEN-COV treatment againstCOVID-19-related hospitalization, severe disease, and death. We compared patientsinfected with Delta variant and treated with REGEN-COV (n = 289) to thoseinfected but not-treated with REGEN-COV (n = 1,296). Demographic and clinicalcharacteristics were used to match patients and for further adjustment as part ofthe C0x model. Estimated treatment effectiveness was defined as one minus thehazard ratio. Treatment effectiveness of REGEN-COV was 56.4% (95% CI: 23.7-75.1%)in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, 59.2% (95% CI: 19.9-79.2%) in preventing severe COVID-19, and 93.5% (95% CI: 52.1-99.1%) in preventing COVID-19 death inthe 28 days after treatment. In conclusion, REGEN-COV was effective in reducingthe risk of severe sequelae in high-risk COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Phages are regarded as powerful antagonists of bacteria, especially in industrialfermentation processes involving bacteria. While bacteria have developed various defense mechanisms, most of which are effective against a narrow range of phages and consequently exert limited protection from phage infection. Here, we report astrategy for developing phage-resistant Escherichia coli strains through thesimultaneous genomic integration of a DNA phosphorothioation-based Ssp defensemodule and mutations of components essential for the phage life cycle. Theengineered E. coli strains show strong resistance against diverse phages testedwithout affecting cell growth. Additionally, the resultant engineeredphage-resistant strains maintain the capabilities of producing examplerecombinant proteins, D-amino acid oxidase and coronavirus-encoded nonstructural protein nsp8, even under high levels of phage cocktail challenge. The strategyreported here will be useful for developing engineered E. coli strains withimproved phage resistance for various industrial fermentation processes forproducing recombinant proteins and chemicals of interest.

PG  - 265
LID - 10.1038/s41392-022-01125-5 [doi]
AB  - Disturbed cholesterol homeostasis plays critical roles in the development ofmultiple diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), neurodegenerativediseases and cancers, particularly the CVD in which the accumulation of lipids(mainly the cholesteryl esters) within macrophage/foam cells underneath theendothelial layer drives the formation of atherosclerotic lesions eventually.More and more studies have shown that lowering cholesterol level, especiallylow-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, protects cardiovascular system andprevents cardiovascular events effectively. Maintaining cholesterol homeostasisis determined by cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, efflux, transport, storage,utilization, and/or excretion. All the processes should be precisely controlledby the multiple regulatory pathways. Based on the regulation of cholesterolhomeostasis, many interventions have been developed to lower cholesterol byinhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake or enhancing cholesterolutilization and excretion. Herein, we summarize the historical review andresearch events, the current understandings of the molecular pathways playing keyroles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, and the cholesterol-loweringinterventions in clinics or in preclinical studies as well as newcholesterol-lowering targets and their clinical advances. More importantly, wereview and discuss the benefits of those interventions for the treatment ofmultiple diseases including atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, obesity,diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,osteoporosis and virus infection.

TI  - BET bromodomain inhibition rescues PD-1-mediated T-cell exhaustion in acutemyeloid leukemia.
PG  - 671
LID - 10.1038/s41419-022-05123-x [doi]
AB  - Sustained expression of programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) is correlatedwith the exhaustion of T cells, and blockade of the PD-1 pathway is an effective immunotherapeutic strategy for treating various cancers. However, response rates are limited, and many patients do not achieve durable responses. Thus, it isimportant to seek additional strategies that can improve anticancer immunity.Here, we report that the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1inhibits PD-1 expression in Jurkat T cells, primary T cells, and T-cellexhaustion models. Furthermore, JQ1 dramatically impaired the expression of PD-1 and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-domain-containing-3 (Tim-3) and promoted thesecretion of cytokines in T cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia(AML). In line with that, BET inhibitor-treated CD19-CAR T and CD123-CAR T cells have enhanced anti-leukemia potency and resistant to exhaustion. Mechanistically,BRD4 binds to the NFAT2 and PDCD1 (encoding PD-1) promoters, and NFAT2 binds tothe PDCD1 and HAVCR2 (encoding Tim-3) promoters. JQ1-treated T cells showeddownregulated NFAT2, PD-1, and Tim-3 expression. In addition, BET inhibitorsuppressed programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and cell growth in AMLcell lines and in primary AML cells. We also demonstrated that JQ1 treatment led to inhibition of leukemia progression, reduced T-cell PD-1/Tim-3 expression, and prolonged survival in MLL-AF9 AML mouse model and Nalm6 (B-cell acutelymphoblastic leukemia cell)-bearing mouse leukemia model. Taken together, BETinhibition improved anti-leukemia immunity by regulating PD-1/PD-L1 expression,and also directly suppressed AML cells, which provides novel insights on themultiple effects of BET inhibition for cancer therapy.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality inchildren, due in part to their distinct immune system, characterized by impaired induction of Th 1 immunity. Here we show application of cationic adjuvantformulation CAF08, a liposomal vaccine formulation tailored to induce Th 1immunity in early life via synergistic engagement of Toll-like Receptor 7/8 andthe C-type lectin receptor Mincle. We apply quantitative phosphoproteomics tohuman dendritic cells and reveal a role for Protein Kinase C-delta for enhancedTh1 cytokine production in neonatal dendritic cells and identify signaling eventsresulting in antigen cross-presentation. In a murine in vivo model a singleimmunization at birth with CAF08-adjuvanted RSV pre-fusion antigen protectsnewborn mice from RSV infection by induction of antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cellsand Th1 cells. Overall, we describe a pediatric adjuvant formulation andcharacterize its mechanism of action providing a promising avenue for developmentof early life vaccines against RSV and other respiratory viral pathogens.

TI  - Targeted enzymatic VLP-nanoreactors with beta-glucocerebrosidase activity aspotential enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease.
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.202200384 [doi]
AB  - Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder and the most common lysosomal diseasecaused by the deficiency of enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Althoughenzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is successfully applied using mannose-exposedconjugated glucocerebrosidase, the lower stability of the enzyme in blood demandsperiodically intravenous administration that adds to the high cost of thetreatment. In this work, the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase was encapsulatedinside virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) from brome mosaic virus (BMV), and theirsurface was functionalized with mannose groups to be targeted to macrophages. TheVLP nanoreactors showed significant GCase catalytic activity. Moreover, theMichaelis-Menten constants for the free GCase enzyme (KM = 0.29 mM) and thefunctionalized nanoreactors (KM = 0.32 mM) were similar even after chemicalmodification. Importantly, the stability of enzymes under physiologicalconditions (pH 7.4, 37 C) was enhanced by 11-fold after encapsulation that isbeneficial for obtaining higher blood circulation half-life, which may reduce thecost of therapy by reducing the requirement of multiple intravenous injections.Finally, the mannose receptor targeted enzymatic nanoreactors showed enhancedinternalization into macrophage cells. Thus, the catalytic activity and celltargeting suggest the potential of these nanoreactors in ERT of Gaucher'sdisease.

TI  - Host response dysregulations amongst adults hospitalized by influenza A H1N1virus pneumonia: A prospective multicenter cohort study.
LID - S0953-6205(22)00259-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2022.07.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists on how early host response impacts outcomes in influenza pneumonia. METHODS: This study assessed what was the contribution ofhost immune response at the emergency department on hospital mortality amongstadults with influenza A H1N1pdm09 pneumonia and whether early stratification byimmune host response anticipates the risk of death. This is a secondary analysis from a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort comparing 75 adultsrequiring intensive care with 38 hospitalized in medical wards. Different immune response biomarkers within 24 h of hospitalization and their association withhospital mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-three were discharged alive.Non-survivors were associated (p<0.05) with lower lymphocytes (751 vs. 387),monocytes (450 vs. 220) expression of HLA-DR (1,662 vs. 962) and higher IgMlevels (178 vs. 152;p<0.01). Lymphocyte subpopulations amongst non-survivorsshowed a significantly (p<0.05) lower number of TCD3+ (247.2 vs. 520.8), TCD4+(150.3 vs. 323.6), TCD8+ (95.3 vs. 151.4) and NKCD56+ (21.9 vs. 91.4). Number of lymphocytes, monocytes and NKCD56+ predicted hospital mortality (AUC 0.854).Hospital mortality was independently associated with low HLA-DR values, lownumber of NKCD56+ cells, and high IgM levels, in a Cox-proportional hazardanalysis. A second model, documented that hospital mortality was independentlyassociated with a phenotype combining immunoparalysis with hyperinflammation (HR 5.53; 95%CI 2.16-14.14), after adjusting by predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that amongst influenza pneumonia, presence of immunoparalysis was amajor mortality driver. Influenza heterogeneity was partly explained by earlyspecific host response dysregulations which should be considered to designpersonalized approaches of adjunctive therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Histologic tumor necrosis (TN) is a well-established independentprognostic indicator in patients treated surgically for clear cell renal cellcarcinoma (ccRCC). However, the precise mechanisms by which TN alters diseaseprogression remain unknown. The DEAD-box protein DDX41, a member of a largefamily of helicases, has been characterized as a pattern recognition receptoragainst an array of double-stranded (ds)DNA produced from bacteria, dsDNAviruses, and nearby cells that have released dsDNA fragments through necrosis. Wehypothesized that DDX41 expression may be upregulated in ccRCC with TN, leadingto worse prognosis. METHODS: Relationship between the presence of TN and DDX41expression were examined using The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets or using ccRCCsamples in our institution. Further, the molecular functions of DDX41 wereinvestigated with human ccRCC cells. RESULTS: The presence of TN wassignificantly associated with the upregulation of mRNA and protein expression of DDX41 in the 2different patient cohorts with ccRCC. In addition, the mRNA andprotein expression levels of DDX41 revealed a worse prognosis. In vitro analyses with ccRCC cells revealed that DDX41 expression promotes tumor-promotingactivity. Furthermore, VHL loss, 1of the most common features in ccRCC, was shownto play an extremely important role in increasing the expression of the CXCLfamily in DDX41-expressing ccRCC, leading to the acquisition of a worse malignantphenotype. CONCLUSIONS: DDX41 expression is associated with TN in ccRCC and leadsto a worse prognosis in cooperation with VHL loss.

TI  - Tumor suppressor p53 inhibits hepatitis C virus replication by inducingE6AP-mediated proteasomal degradation of the viral core protein.
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14461 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in the host defense system againsthepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, although the detailed mechanism remainsunknown. Here, we found that p53 inhibits HCV replication by downregulating HCVCore protein levels in human hepatoma cells. For this effect, p53 potentiated therole of E6-associated protein (E6AP) as an E3 ligase to induce ubiquitination andproteasomal degradation of HCV Core. Specifically, p53 facilitated the binding ofE6AP to HCV Core through direct interactions with the two proteins. In addition, E6AP failed to induce ubiquitination of HCV Core in the absence of p53,suggesting that p53 increases the E3 ligase activity of E6AP in a triple complex consisting of p53, E6AP, and HCV Core.

PG  - E714-E720

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians have had concernsrelated to the impact of the pandemic on their practice of medicine. Ourobjective was to evaluate physician questions and concerns related to theCOVID-19 pandemic by studying physician calls made to a medico-legal telephonehelpline, and explore associations between the pattern of these calls and thetemporal progression of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive studyof calls related to the COVID-19 pandemic to the Canadian Medical ProtectiveAssociation (CMPA) from Jan. 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Using content analysis,we classified calls into themes. Using a Poisson regression model, we tested for associations between the weekly numbers of physician calls related to COVID-19and national rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. RESULTS: We analyzed 3810COVID-19-related calls. The highest call volume was observed during thepandemic's early months and was widely distributed across the country. Callvolume correlated with rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic's first wave (p = 0.002) but not across the entire study period. Call themes includedvirtual care (826 calls), the pandemic's effect on health care (1160 calls) andchallenging patient interactions (1091 calls). INTERPRETATION: We observed highvolumes of physician calls to a medico-legal helpline during the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Our data provide insight into the questionsand concerns of Canadian physicians, and serve as a contemporaneous account ofthe adaptability and resilience of physicians during this challenging time.

TI  - Positive strand RNA viruses differ in the constraints they place on the foldingof their negative strand.
LID - rna.079125.122 [pii]
LID - 10.1261/rna.079125.122 [doi]
AB  - Genome replication of positive strand RNA viruses requires the production of acomplementary negative strand RNA that serves as a template for synthesis of morepositive strand progeny. Structural RNA elements are important for genomereplication, but while they are readily observed in the positive strand, evidenceof their existence in the negative strand is more limited. We hypothesised thatthis was due to viruses differing in their capacity to allow this latter RNA toadopt structural folds. To investigate this, ribozymes were introduced into thenegative strand of different viral constructs; the expectation being that if RNA folding occurred, negative strand cleavage and suppression of replication wouldbe seen. Indeed this was what happened with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and felinecalicivirus (FCV) constructs. However, little or no impact was observed forchikungunya virus (CHIKV), human rhinovirus (HRV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) andyellow fever virus (YFV) constructs. Reduced cleavage in the negative strandproved to be due to duplex formation with the positive strand. Interestingly,ribozyme-containing RNAs also remained intact when produced in vitro by the HCVpolymerase, again due to duplex formation. Overall, our results show that thereare important differences in the conformational constraints imposed on thefolding of the negative strand between different positive strand RNA viruses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the durability of response 3 months after the thirdBNT162b2 vaccine in adults aged 60 years and older. DESIGN: Prospective cohortstudy. SETTING: Single tertiary centre. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers/familymembers aged >/=60 years old who received the third BNT162b2 dose. INTERVENTIONS:Blood samples were drawn immediately before (T0), 10-19 days (T1) and 74-103 days(T2) after the third dose. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-spike IgGtitres were determined using a commercial assay and seropositivity was defined as>/=50 arbitrary units (AU)/mL. Neutralising antibody titres were determined atT2. Adverse events, COVID-19 infections and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) levelswere documented. RESULTS: The analysis included 97 participants (median age, 70years (IQR, 66-74), 58% CFS level 2). IgG titres, which increased significantlyfrom T0 to T1 (median, 440 AU/mL (IQR, 294-923) and median, 25 429 AU/mL (IQR, 14203-36 114), respectively; p<0.001), decreased significantly by T2, but allremained seropositive (median, 8306 AU/mL (IQR, 4595-14 701), p<0.001 vs T1). In a multivariable analysis, only time from the second vaccine was significantlyassociated with lower IgG levels at T2 (p=0.017). At T2, 60 patients wereevaluated for neutralising antibodies; all were seropositive (median, 1294antibody titres; IQR, 848-2072). Neutralising antibody and anti-spike IgG levels were correlated (r=0.6, p<0.001). No major adverse events or COVID-19 infections were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-spike IgG and neutralising antibody levelsremain adequate 3 months after the third BNT162b2 vaccine in healthy adults aged >/=60 years, although the decline in IgG is concerning. A third dose of vaccinein this population should be top priority.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prophylactic vaccine is needed to control the HCV epidemic, withgenotypes 1-3 causing >80% of worldwide infections. Vaccine development ishampered by HCV heterogeneity, viral escape including protection of conservedneutralising epitopes and suboptimal efficacy of HCV cell culture systems. Wedeveloped cell culture-based inactivated genotype 1-3 HCV vaccine candidates topresent natively folded envelope proteins to elicit neutralising antibodies.DESIGN: High-yield genotype 1a, 2a and 3a HCV were developed by serial passage ofTNcc, J6cc and DBN3acc in Huh7.5 cells and engineering of acquired mutationsdetected by next-generation sequencing. Neutralising epitope exposure wasdetermined in cell-based neutralisation assays using human monoclonal antibodies AR3A and AR4A, and polyclonal antibody C211. BALB/c mice were immunised withprocessed and inactivated genotype 1a, 2a or 3a viruses using AddaVax, ahomologue of the licenced adjuvant MF-59. Purified mouse and patient serum IgGwere assayed for neutralisation capacity; mouse IgG and immune-sera were assayed for E1/E2 binding. RESULTS: Compared with the original viruses, high-yieldviruses had up to ~1000 fold increased infectivity titres (peak titres: 6-7 log10focus-forming units (FFU)/mL) and up to ~2470 fold increased exposure ofconserved neutralising epitopes. Vaccine-induced IgG broadly neutralised genotype1-6 HCV (EC50: 30-193 microg/mL; mean 71 microg/mL), compared favourably with IgGfrom chronically infected patients, and bound genotype 1-3 E1/E2; immune-seraendpoint titres reached up to 32 000. CONCLUSION: High-yield genotype 1-3 HCVcould be developed as basis for inactivated vaccine candidates inducing broadlyneutralising antibodies in mice supporting further preclinical development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron BA.1compared with delta (B.1.617.2). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:England, United Kingdom, from 1 December 2021 to 30 December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 1 035 149 people aged 18-100 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 under thenational surveillance programme and had an infection identified as omicron BA.1or delta compatible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was covid-19death as identified from death certification records. The exposure of interestwas the SARS-CoV-2 variant identified from NHS Test and Trace PCR positive tests taken in the community (pillar 2) and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Cause specific Cox proportional hazard regression models (censoring non-covid-19deaths) were adjusted for sex, age, vaccination status, previous infection,calendar time, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation rank, householddeprivation, university degree, keyworker status, country of birth, mainlanguage, region, disability, and comorbidities. Interactions between variant andsex, age, vaccination status, and comorbidities were also investigated. RESULTS: The risk of covid-19 death was 66% lower (95% confidence interval 54% to 75%) foromicron BA.1 compared with delta after adjusting for a wide range of potentialconfounders. The reduction in the risk of covid-19 death for omicron comparedwith delta was more pronounced in people aged 18-59 years (number of deaths:delta=46, omicron=11; hazard ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.27)than in those aged >/=70 years (number of deaths: delta=113, omicron=135; hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.61, P<0.0001). No evidence of adifference in risk was found between variant and number of comorbidities.CONCLUSIONS: The results support earlier studies showing a reduction in severity of infection with omicron BA.1 compared with delta in terms of hospitaladmission. This study extends the research to also show a reduction in the riskof covid-19 death for the omicron variant compared with the delta variant.

TI  - Uncovering SARS-COV-2 vaccine uptake and COVID-19 impacts among First Nations,Inuit and Metis Peoples living in Toronto and London, Ontario.
PG  - E1018-E1026
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.212147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: First Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples across geographies are athigher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 because of high rates of chronicdisease, inadequate housing and barriers to accessing health services. MostIndigenous Peoples in Canada live in cities, where SARS-CoV-2 infection isconcentrated. To address gaps in SARS-CoV-2 information for these urbanpopulations, we partnered with Indigenous agencies and sought to generate ratesof SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination, and incidence of infection for FirstNations, Inuit and Metis living in 2 Ontario cities. METHODS: We drew on existingcohorts of First Nations, Inuit and Metis adults in Toronto (n = 723) and London (n = 364), Ontario, who were recruited using respondent-driven sampling. Welinked to ICES SARS-CoV-2 databases and prospectively monitored rates ofSARS-CoV-2 testing, diagnosis and vaccination for First Nations, Inuit and Metis,and comparator city and Ontario populations. RESULTS: We found that SARS-CoV-2testing rates among First Nations, Inuit and Metis were higher in Toronto (54.7%,95% confidence interval [CI] 48.1% to 61.3%) and similar in London (44.5%, 95% CI36.0% to 53.1%) compared with local and provincial rates. We determined thatcumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly differentamong First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto (7364/100 000, 95% CI 2882 to 11 847) or London (7707/100 000, 95% CI 2215 to 13 200) compared with city rates. Wefound that rates of vaccination among First Nations, Inuit and Metis in Toronto(58.2%, 95% CI 51.4% to 64.9%) and London (61.5%, 95% CI 52.9% to 70.0%) werelower than the rates for the 2 cities and Ontario. INTERPRETATION: AlthoughOntario government policies prioritized Indigenous populations for SARS-CoV-2vaccination, vaccine uptake was lower than in the general population for FirstNations, Inuit and Metis Peoples in Toronto and London. Ongoing access toculturally safe testing and vaccinations is urgently required to avoiddisproportionate hospital admisson and mortality related to COVID-19 in thesecommunities.

AB  - COVID-19 wastewater-based epidemiology has been performed in catchments ofvarious sizes and sewer types with many short-term studies available andmulti-seasonal studies emerging. The objective of this study was to compareweekly observations of SARS-CoV-2 genes in municipal wastewater across multipleseasons for different systems as a factor of sewer type (combined, separatesanitary) and system size. Sampling occurred following the first wave ofSARS-CoV-2 cases in the study region (June 2020) and continued through the third wave (May 2021), the period during which clinical testing was widely availableand different variants dominated clinical cases. The strongest correlations were observed between wastewater N1 concentrations and the cumulative clinical casesreported in the 2 weeks prior to wastewater sampling, followed by the week prior,new cases, and the week after wastewater sampling. Sewer type and size did notnecessarily explain the strength of the correlations, indicating that othernon-sewer factors may be impacting the observations. In-system sampling resultsfor the largest system sampled are presented for 1 month. Removing wet weatherdays from the data sets improved even the flow-normalized correlations for thesystems, potentially indicating that interpreting results during wet weatherevents may be more complicated than simply accounting for dilution. PRACTITIONER POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater correlated best with total clinical casesreported in 2 weeks before wastewater sampling at the utility level. Studyperformed when clinical testing was widespread during the year after the firstCOVID-19 wave in the region. Sewer type and size did not necessarily explaincorrelation strength between clinical cases and wastewater-based epidemiologyresults. Removing wet weather days improved correlations for 3/4 utilitiesstudied, including both separate sanitary and combined sewers.

TI  - Characterization and cross-protection of experimental infections with SeCoV andtwo PEDV variants.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14674 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the infection of weaned pigs with swineenteric coronavirus (SeCoV) -a chimeric virus most likely originated from arecombination event between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) andtransmissible gastroenteritis virus, or its mutant porcine respiratorycoronavirus-, and two PEDV G1b variants, including a recently describedrecombinant PEDV-SeCoV (rPEDV-SeCoV), as well as to determine the degree ofcross-protection achieved against the rPEDV-SeCoV. For this purpose, forty-eight 4-week-old weaned pigs were randomly allocated into four groups of 12 animals;piglets within each group were primary inoculated with one of the investigatedviral strains (B: PEDV; C: SeCoV and D: rPEDV-SeCoV) or mock-inoculated (A), and exposed to rPEDV-SeCOV at day 20 post-infection; thus, group A was primarychallenged (-/rPEDV-SeCoV), groups B and C were subjected to a heterologousre-challenge (PEDV/rPEDV-SeCoV and SeCoV/rPEDV-SeCoV, respectively), and group D to a homologous re-challenge (rPEDV-SeCoV/rPEDV-SeCoV), Clinical signs, viralshedding, microscopic lesions and specific humoral and cellular immune responses (IgG, IgA, neutralizing antibodies and IgA and IFN-gamma-secreting cells) weremonitored. After primo-infection all three viral strains induced anundistinguishable mild-to-moderate clinical disease with diarrhea as the mainsign and villus shortening lesions in the small intestine. In homologousre-challenged pigs, no clinical signs or lesions were observed, and viralshedding was only detected in a single animal. This fact may be explained by the significant high level of rPEDV-SeCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies found inthese pigs before the challenge. In contrast, prior exposure to a different PEDV G1b variant or SeCoV only provided partial cross-protection, allowing rPEDV-SeCoVreplication and shedding in feces.

AB  - Dyslipidemia, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol levels, causesatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and increases the risk ofmyocardial infarction and stroke. Statins, a class of drugs that exert theireffects by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis ofcholesterol, have been the mainstay of therapy for the primary prevention ofcardiovascular disease and lipids reduction. Statins are associated with sideeffects, most commonly myopathy and myalgias, despite their proven efficacy. Thisreview explores non-statin lipid-lowering therapies and examines recent advances and emerging research. Over the previous decades, several lipid-loweringtherapies, both as monotherapy and adjuncts to statin therapy and lipid-targetinggene therapy, have emerged, thus redefining how we treat dyslipidemia. Thesedrugs include Bile acids sequestrants, Fibrates, Nicotinic acid, Ezetimibe,Bempedoic acid, Volanesoren, Evinacumab, and the PCSK 9 Inhibitors Evolocumab andAlirocumab. Emerging gene-based therapy includes Small interfering RNAs,Antisense oligonucleotides, Adeno-associated virus vectors, CRISPR/Cas9 basedtherapeutics, and Non-coding RNA therapy. Of all these therapies, Bempedoic acid works most like statins by working through a similar pathway to decreasecholesterol levels. However, it is not associated with myopathy. Overall,although statins continue to be the gold standard, non-statin therapies are setto play an increasingly important role in managing dyslipidemia.

AB  - Marek's disease virus (MDV), a highly contagious cell associated virus, is theetiological agent of Marek's disease (MD), a lymphoproliferative and neuropathic disease of domestic chickens. Clinical signs of MD include transient paralysis,bursal/thymic atrophy, and T cell lymphomas. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are shortsingle-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by transcriptional suppression or mRNA degradation. Herpesviruses, including MDV, encode for miRNAs that are known to play essential roles in viral pathogenicity, oncogenesis, andevasion of immune responses. In this study, we performed miRNA sequencing inthymuses of control and MDV-infected chickens of MD-resistant (63) andsusceptible (72) lines at 21 days post infection (dpi). The thymus is a lymphoid organ that undergoes severe atrophy due to MDV-induced apoptotic mediateddestruction of T cells. Sequence analysis identified 658 total chicken miRNAs in the thymuses of control and MDV-infected birds of both lines. Of these, 453 were novel and 205 were known microRNAs. All novel miRNAs mapped to chicken genomewith no sequence homology to existing miRNAs in the chicken miRbase. Comparative analysis between the thymuses of control and infected birds of resistant andsusceptible lines identified 78 differentially expressed microRNAs that mightprovide insights into mechanisms of thymus atrophy.

AB  - The frequently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have weakened the effectiveness ofexisting COVID-19 vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapy. Nevertheless, theinfections of SARS-CoV-2 variants still depend on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptor-mediated cell entry, and thus the soluble human ACE2 (shACE2) is a potential decoy for broadly blocking SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, wefirstly generated the recombinant AAVrh10-vectored shACE2 constructs, a kind ofadeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype with pulmonary tissue tropism, and thenvalidated its inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. To furtheroptimize the minimized ACE2 functional domain candidates, a comprehensiveanalysis was performed to clarify the interactions between the ACE2 orthologsfrom various species and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike(S) protein. Based on the key interface amino acids, we designed a series oftruncated ACE2 orthologs, and then assessed their potential affinity to bind toSARS-CoV-2 variants RBD in silico. Of note, we found that the 24-83aa fragment ofdog ACE2 (dACE224-83) had a higher affinity to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variantsthan that of human ACE2. Importantly, AAVrh10-vectored shACE2 or dACE224-83constructs exhibited a broadly blockage breadth against SARS-CoV-2 prototype and and variants in vitro and ex vivo. Collectively, these data highlighted apromising therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the control of human viralinfections but their activity is significantly impaired in patients infected withchronic hepatitis B (CHB). The mechanism that contributes to NK cell dysfunction in CHB needs further elucidation. In this study, we analyzed the expression andfunction of the novel inhibitory receptor immunoglobulin-like transcript-2 (ILT2)on NK cells from 131 CHB patients and 36 healthy controls. We observed that ILT2 expression on circulating CD56(dim)CD16(+)NK cells was increased inimmune-tolerant, immune-active and HBeAg-negative hepatitis patients comparedwith inactive carriers and controls. The frequency of ILT2(+)CD56(dim)NK cellswas positively correlated with serum viral load in immune-tolerant patients. The percentage of ILT2(+)CD56(dim)NK cells decreased along with HBV load in CHBpatients who received antiviral therapy. Functional analysis showed thatILT2(+)CD56(dim)NK cells in CHB patients had significantly reduced degranulation and IFN-gamma production. Upregulation of ILT2 was associated with high levels ofapoptosis in CD56(dim)CD16(+)NK cells from CHB patients. ILT2 blockade was shown to increase the cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production of CD56(dim)NK cells insome CHB patients. Finally, ILT2 was found to be moderately upregulated byTGF-beta1, which was increased in immune-tolerant, immune-active andHBeAg-negative hepatitis patients. Our results show that chronic HBV infectionincreases the levels of the inhibitory receptor ILT2 on CD56(dim)NK cells andinhibits their functions, providing a new mechanism of NK-cell disability in CHB patients.

AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, new variants have continuously emerged andspread in populations. Among these, variants of concern (VOC) have been the main culprits of successive epidemic waves, due to their transmissibility,pathogenicity or ability to escape the immune response. Quantification of theSARS-CoV-2 genomes in raw wastewater is a reliable approach well-described andwidely deployed worldwide to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humanpopulations connected to sewage systems. Discrimination of VOCs in wastewater is also a major issue and can be achieved by genome sequencing or by detection ofspecific mutations suggesting the presence of VOCs. This study aimed to date the emergence of these VOCs (from Alpha to Omicron BA.2) by monitoring wastewaterfrom the greater Paris area, France, but also to model the propagation dynamicsof these VOCs and to characterize the replacement kinetics of the prevalentpopulations. These dynamics were compared to various individual-centered publichealth data, such as regional incidence and the proportions of VOCs identified bysequencing of strains isolated from patient. The viral dynamics in wastewaterhighlighted the impact of the vaccination strategy on the viral circulationwithin human populations but also suggested its potential effect on the selectionof variants most likely to be propagated in immunized populations. Normalization of concentrations to capture population movements appeared statistically morereliable using variations in local drinking water consumption rather than usingPMMoV concentrations because PMMoV fecal shedding was subject to variability and was not sufficiently relevant in this study. The dynamics of viral spread wasobserved earlier (about 13days on the wave related to Omicron VOC) in rawwastewater than the regional incidence alerting to a possible risk ofdecorrelation between incidence and actual virus circulation probably resultingfrom a lower severity of infection in vaccinated populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma patients often suffer from frequent respiratory viralinfections and reduced virus clearance. Lung resident memory T cells providerapid protection against viral re-infections. OBJECTIVE: As development ofresident memory T cells relies on the lung microenvironment, we investigated the impact of allergen sensitisation on the development of virus-specific lungresident memory T cells and viral clearance. METHODS: Mice were sensitised withhouse dust mite extract followed by priming with X47 and a subsequent secondaryinfluenza infection. Anti-viral memory T cell responses and protection to viralinfection was assessed pre- and post-secondary influenza infection, respectively.Gene set variation analysis was performed on datasets from U-BIOPRED asthmacohort using an IFN-induced epithelial cell signature and a tissue residentmemory T cell signature. RESULTS: Viral loads were higher in lungs of sensitised compared to non-sensitised mice post-secondary infection, indicating reducedvirus clearance. X47 priming induced fewer anti-viral lung resident memory CD8 T cells and resulted in lower pulmonary IFN levels in the lungs of sensitised ascompared to non-sensitised mice. Using data from the U-BIOPRED cohort, we foundthat patients with enrichment of epithelial IFN-induced genes in nasal brushings and bronchial biopsies were also enriched in TRM associated genes, had moreepithelial CD8 T cells and reported significantly fewer exacerbations.CONCLUSION: The allergen sensitised lung microenvironment interferes with theformation of anti-viral resident memory CD8 T cells in lungs and virus clearance.Defective anti-viral memory response might contribute to increased susceptibilityof asthma patients to viral exacerbations.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a chronic diseasewithout a known cure. The advent of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) hasenabled people with HIV (PWH) to have significantly prolonged life expectancies. As a result, morbidity and mortality associated with HIV-1 infection havedeclined considerably. However, these individuals experience chronic systemicinflammation whose multifaceted etiology is associated with other numerouscomorbidities. Inflammasomes are vital mediators that contribute to inflammatory signaling in HIV-1 infection. Here, we provide an overview of the inflammatorypathway that underlies HIV-1 infection, explicitly highlighting the role of theNLRP3 inflammasome. We also delineate the current literature on inflammasomes andthe therapeutic targeting strategies aimed at the NLRP3 inflammasome to moderate HIV-1 infection-associated inflammation. Here we describe the NLRP3 inflammasome as a key pathway in developing novel therapeutic targets to block HIV-1replication and HIV-1-associated inflammatory signaling. Controlling theinflammatory pathways is critical in alleviating the morbidities and mortalityassociated with chronic HIV-1 infection in PWH.

AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most concerning pathogens inpenaeid shrimp and can cause severe loss in shrimp aquaculture worldwide. Amongthe WSSV structural proteins, VP15, a DNA-binding protein located in the WSSVnucleocapsid, is an antiviral protein candidate to protect kuruma shrimp(Marsupenaeus japonicus) from WSSV infection. We identified that the truncatedVP15, VP15(26-57), is responsible for the protective effect against the WSSV.This study attempts to develop an immunizing agent against WSSV using silkwormpupa as a delivery vector through oral administration. The VP15, VP15(26-57), andSR11 peptide derived from VP15(26-57) were expressed in silkworm pupae. Oraladministration of feed mixed with the powdered pupae that expressed VP15-derived constructs enhanced the survivability of kuruma shrimp with an overall relativepercent survival (RPS) higher than 70%. There is no death for the group receivingpupa/VP15(26-57), and the RPS is 100%. In addition, we also investigated therelative mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes by qPCR at different timepoints. Our results indicate that the oral administration of pupa/VP15-derivedproducts could provide a high protective effect against WSSV and be a practicalapproach for controlling WSSV in aquaculture.

AB  - A role for ferroptosis in articular cartilage destruction associated withrheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been identified. We previously reportedtransient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) expression was correlated with RA cartilage destruction. Herein, we further characterized a role for TRPM7 inchondrocyte ferroptosis. The expression of TRPM7 was found to be elevated inarticular chondrocytes derived from adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats, human RApatients, and cultured chondrocytes treated with the ferroptosis inducer,erastin. TRPM7 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition protected primary ratarticular chondrocytes and human chondrocytes (C28/I2 cells) from ferroptosis.Moreover, TRPM7 channel activity was demonstrated to contribute to chondrocyteferroptosis by elevation of intracellular Ca(2+). Mechanistically, thePKCalpha-NOX4 axis was found to respond to stimulation with erastin, whichresulted in TRPM7-mediated chondrocyte ferroptosis. Meanwhile, PKCalpha was shownto directly bind to NOX4, which could be reduced by TRPM7 channel inhibition.Adeno-associated virus 9-mediated TRPM7 silencing or TRPM7 blockade with 2-APBalleviated articular cartilage destruction in AA rats and inhibited chondrocyteferroptosis. Collectively, both genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of TRPM7 attenuated articular cartilage damage and chondrocyte ferroptosis via thePKCalpha-NOX4 axis, suggesting that TRPM7-mediated chondrocyte ferroptosis is apromising target for the prevention and treatment of RA.

AB  - The increased transmissibility of the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virusresulted in a rapid increase in infection among many psychiatric inpatients inour hospital between December 2021 and February 2022. This required ourinstitution to close affected units to new admissions. In response, weimplemented a model utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction(PCR) testing at the time of admission, the development of "admitting units"where all patients were quarantined for four days followed by repeat PCR testing,and subsequent transition to COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive "receivingunits" based on the results of the second test. No unit closures occurredfollowing full implementation of the model.

AB  - Rational detection of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial toprevention, control, and treatment of disease. Herein, a dual-wavelengthratiometric electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on resonance energytransfer (RET) between g-C3N4 nanosheets and Ru-SiO2@folic acid (FA)nanomaterials was designed to realize ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2virus (RdRp gene). Firstly, the unique g-C3N4 nanosheets displayed very intenseand stable ECL at 460 nm, then the triple helix DNA was stably and verticallybound to g-C3N4 on electrode by high binding affinity between ssDNA and g-C3N4.Meanwhile, trace amounts of target genes were converted to a large number ofoutput by three-dimensional (3D) DNA walker multiple amplification, and theoutput bridged a multifunctional probe Ru-SiO2@FA to electrode. Ru-SiO2@FA notonly showed high ECL at 620 nm, but also effectively quenched g-C3N4 ECL. As aresult, ECL decreased at 460 nm and increased at 620 nm, which was used to designa rational ECL biosensor for detection of SARS gene. The results show that thebiosensor has excellent detection sensitivity for RdRp gene with a dynamicdetection range of 1 fM to 10 nM and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.18 fM. Thedual-wavelength ratio ECL biosensor has inestimable value and applicationprospects in the fields of biosensing and clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Clozapine has superior efficacy in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia;however, use of clozapine is limited due to severe side effects, includingmyocarditis. Using non-integrative Sendai virus, we generated induced pluripotentstem cell lines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients withrefractory schizophrenia, one clozapine-tolerant and one clozapine-inducedmyocarditis. Both cell lines exhibited a normal karyotype and pluripotency wasvalidated by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and their ability todifferentiate into the three germ layers. These lines can be used to generate 2D and 3D patient-specific human cellular models to identify the mechanism by which clozapine induces myocardial inflammation.

TI  - Conceptual Framework for Cancer Care During a Pandemic Incorporating EvidenceFrom the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - e2200043
LID - 10.1200/GO.22.00043 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: With successive infection waves and the spread of more infectiousvariants, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major impacts on health care.To achieve best outcomes for patients with cancer during a pandemic, efforts tominimize the increased risk of severe pandemic infection must be carefullybalanced against unintended adverse impacts of the pandemic on cancer care, with consideration to available health system capacity. Cancer Australia's conceptual framework for cancer care during a pandemic provides a planning resource forhealth services and policy-makers that can be broadly applied globally and tosimilar pandemics. METHODS: Evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic oncancer care and health system capacity to June 2021 was reviewed, and theconceptual framework was developed and updated. RESULTS: Components of healthsystem capacity vary during a pandemic, and capacity relative to pandemic numbersand severity affects resources available for cancer care delivery. The challengesof successive pandemic waves and high numbers of pandemic cases necessitateconsideration of changing health system capacity in decision making about cancer care. Cancer Australia's conceptual framework provides guidance on continuationof care across the cancer pathway, in the face of challenges to health systems,while minimizing infection risk for patients with cancer and unintendedconsequences of delays in screening, diagnosis, and cancer treatment and backlogsbecause of service interruption. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic supports continuation of cancer care wherever possible during similar pandemics. Cancer Australia's conceptual framework, underpinned by principles for optimalcancer care, informs decision making across the cancer care continuum. Itincorporates consideration of changes in health system capacity and capacity for cancer care, in relation to pandemic progression, enabling broad applicability todifferent global settings.

TI  - Omicron-associated changes in SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in the United Kingdom.
LID - ciac613 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has been replaced by the highlytransmissible Omicron BA.1 variant, and subsequently by Omicron BA.2. It isimportant to understand how these changes in dominant variants affect reportedsymptoms, while also accounting for symptoms arising from other co-circulatingrespiratory viruses. METHODS: In a nationally representative UK community study, the COVID-19 Infection Survey, we investigated symptoms in PCR-positive infectionepisodes vs. PCR-negative study visits over calendar time, by age and vaccinationstatus, comparing periods when the Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants weredominant. RESULTS: Between October-2020 and April-2022, 120,995 SARS-CoV-2PCR-positive episodes occurred in 115,886 participants, with 70,683 (58%)reporting symptoms. The comparator comprised 4,766,366 PCR-negative study visits (483,894 participants); 203,422 (4%) reporting symptoms. Symptom reporting inPCR-positives varied over time, with a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell asOmicron BA.1 dominated, maintained with BA.2 (44%/45% 17 October 2021, 16%/13% 2 January 2022, 15%/12% 27 March 2022). Cough, fever, shortness of breath, myalgia,fatigue/weakness and headache also decreased after Omicron BA.1 dominated, butsore throat increased, the latter to a greater degree than concurrent increasesin PCR-negatives. Fatigue/weakness increased again after BA.2 dominated, althoughto a similar degree to concurrent increases in PCR-negatives. Symptoms wereconsistently more common in adults aged 18-65 years than in children or olderadults. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in sore throat (also common in the generalcommunity), and a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell, make Omicron harder todetect with symptom-based testing algorithms, with implications for institutionaland national testing policies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The exact animal origin of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains obscure and understanding its host range isvital for preventing interspecies transmission. METHODS: Herein, we appliedsingle-cell sequencing to multiple tissues of 20 species (30 data sets) andintegrated them with public resources (45 data sets covering 26 species) toexpand the virus receptor distribution investigation. While the binding affinity between virus and receptor is essential for viral infectivity, understanding the receptor distribution could predict the permissive organs and tissues wheninfection occurs. RESULTS: Based on the transcriptomic data, the expressionprofiles of receptor or associated entry factors for viruses capable of causingrespiratory, blood, and brain diseases were described in detail. Conservedcellular connectomes and regulomes were also identified, revealing fundamentalcell-cell and gene-gene cross-talks from reptiles to humans. CONCLUSIONS:Overall, our study provides a resource of the single-cell atlas of the animalkingdom which could help to identify the potential host range and tissue tropism of viruses and reveal the host-virus co-evolution.

TI  - MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OF HAWAIIAN GEESE (BRANTA SANDVICENSIS) AND LAYSANALBATROSS (PHOEBASTRIA IMMUTABILIS) ASSOCIATED WITH RETICULOENDOTHELIOSIS VIRUS.
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00164 [doi]
AB  - Only one virus, Avipox, has been documented previously in wild birds in Hawaii.Using immunohistochemistry and PCR, we found that two native threatened Hawaiian Geese (Branta sandvicensis), one with multicentric histiocytoma and the otherwith toxoplasmosis, and one Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) with avianpox were infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). The virus was isolated from one of the geese by cell culture. Surveys of other Hawaiian geese withvarious pathologies, avian pox cases, and pox viral isolates using PCR failed to reveal REV, suggesting that the virus is uncommon, at least in samples examined. The full genome of the Gag, Pol, and Env genes were sequenced for all threeinfected birds and revealed geographic divergence of the Pol gene, suggesting it to be under strong selective pressure. Our finding of REV in Hawaii makes thisonly the second virus documented in native Hawaiian birds associated withpathology. Moreover, the presence of REV in a pelagic seabird is unusual. Future surveys should seek the reservoir of the virus in efforts to trace its origins.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the world's adult populationand accounts for a significant cancer burden of epithelial and B cell origins.Glycoprotein B (gB) is the primary fusogen essential for EBV entry into hostcells. Here, we isolated two EBV gB-specific neutralizing antibodies, 3A3 and3A5; both effectively neutralized the dual-tropic EBV infection of B andepithelial cells. In humanized mice, both antibodies showed effective protection from EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disorders. Cryoelectron microscopy analyses identified that 3A3 and 3A5 bind to nonoverlapping sites on domains D-II andD-IV, respectively. Structure-based mutagenesis revealed that 3A3 and 3A5 inhibitmembrane fusion through different mechanisms involving the interference withgB-cell interaction and gB activation. Importantly, the 3A3 and 3A5 epitopes are major targets of protective gB-specific neutralizing antibodies elicited bynatural EBV infection in humans, providing potential targets for antiviraltherapies and vaccines.

AB  - How does the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? Most evidence showsthat natural disasters reinforce trust and cooperation, but the COVID-19 virusdiffers from other calamities, since it spreads through contact with people,potentially increasing suspicion and distrust, as, according to contemporaneouswriters' accounts, seems to have been the case with the Black Death, the Londonplague, and the Spanish influenza. We investigate the link between interpersonal trust and individuals exposed to COVID-19, either vicariously through theircommunity or networks or directly by becoming infected. We rely on an originalpanel survey, including a survey experiment, with a representative sample ofadults in Italy, one of the countries hardest struck by the pandemic. Ourexperimental findings reveal that priming people about the risk that the pandemicposes to their health leads to a substantial increase in their trust instrangers. Our panel data analysis of within-individual effects shows that those who become infected trust strangers more than those who are not infected. Ourfindings could be explained by people observing higher than expected altruisticbehavior or becoming more dependent on other people's support, consistent withthe "emancipation theory of trust." When people recover from COVID-19, however,they drop to trusting strangers as much as those who were not directly exposed tothe virus, an indication that the positive effects on trust during the pandemichave an emotional source. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that, in theaggregate, there has been a small but significant increase in trust among thegeneral population relative to prepandemic levels.

AB  - The current Covid-19 pandemic has a profound impact on all aspects of our lives. Aside from contagion by aerosols, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 is ubiquitous onsurfaces that millions of people handle daily. Therefore, controlling thispandemic involves the reduction of potential infections via contaminatedsurfaces. We developed antiviral surfaces by preparing suspensions of copper and cupric oxide nanoparticles in two different polymer matrices, poly(methylmethacrylate) and polyepoxide. For total copper contents as low as 5%, thecomposite material showed remarkable antiviral properties against the HCoV-OC43human coronavirus and against a model lentivirus and proved well-resistant toaccelerated aging conditions. Importantly, we showed that the Cu/CuO mixtureshowed optimal performances. This product can be implemented to produce a simple and inexpensive coating with long-term antiviral properties and will open the wayto developing surface coatings against a broad spectrum of pathogens includingSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection is commonlyreported in countries of Northeast Asia including China, Japan and South Korea.The majority of the SFTS patients are elderly and the average fatality rate ismore than 10%. A rapid and sensitive diagnostic method to monitor and preventSFTSV transmission remains an urgent clinical challenge. In this study, wedeveloped a molecular diagnostic technique for detection of SFTSV using theCRISPR-Cas12a system combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymeraseamplification (RT-RPA). Using this method, we successfully diagnosed SFTSVinfections with the reaction time of 50 min from blood plasma withoutcross-reactivity to other viruses, supporting its application for rapid andsensitive diagnosis of SFTS.

AB  - Introduction COVID- 19 is a disease that has claimed the lives of many people.However, alterations in labo-ratory profiles in the city of Tacna have not beenaccurately established in association with its severity to support diagnosis and treatment. Objective To determine biomarkers related to the severity of COVID- 19in patients treated at the social security hospital in Tacna during 2020. MethodsWe performed an observational, cross- sectional, and analytical study thatincluded 308 patients with COVID- 19 from the social security hospital in Tacna, Peru, during the "first wave" of the pandemic (from July to August 2020).Immunological, hematological, arterial gas, hemostasis, and biochemical markerswere collected. Patients were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe basedon the clinical criteria found on clinical records. Correlation strength wasper-formed according to Spearman's Rho coefficient. The performance of thebiomarkers associat-ed with severity was analyzed with the Receiver OperatingCharacteristic curve. Results Regarding hematological markers there was apositive correlation with monocyte count (correla-tion coefficient: 0.841; areaunder the curve 97.0%; p < 0.05) and a negative correlation with lymphocyte count(correlation coefficient: -0.622; area under the curve 82.7%; p < 0.05).Regarding biochemical markers, arterial gases and hemostasis, no significantcorrelations were found. In immunological markers, we found positive correlation with ferritin (correlation coef-ficient: 0.805; area under the curve 94.0%; p <0.05), and C- reactive protein (correlation coeffi-cient: 0.587; area under thecurve 87.4%; p < 0.05). Conclusions The biomarkers that can be considered asparameters associated with the severity of COVID- 19 are the absolute blood countof monocytes and serum ferritin concentration.

TI  - The effect of a temperature-sensitive prophage on the evolution of virulence inan opportunistic bacterial pathogen.
LID - 10.1111/mec.16638 [doi]
AB  - Viruses are key actors of ecosystems and have major impacts on globalbiogeochemical cycles. Prophages deserve particular attention as they areubiquitous in bacterial genomes and can enter a lytic cycle when triggered byenvironmental conditions. We explored how temperature affects the interactionsbetween prophages and other biological levels by using an opportunistic pathogen,the bacterium Serratia marcescens, that harbours several prophages and that hadundergone an evolution experiment under several temperature regimes. We foundthat the release of one of the prophages was temperature-sensitive and malleable to evolutionary changes. We further discovered that the virulence of thebacterium in an insect model also evolved and was positively correlated withphage release rates. We determined through analysis of genetic and epigeneticdata that changes in the bacterial outer cell wall structure possibly explainthis phenomenon. We hypothezise that the temperature-dependent phage release rateacted as a selection pressure on S. marcescens and that it resulted in modifiedbacterial virulence in the insect host. Our study system illustrates how viruses can mediate the inuence of abiotic environmental changes to other biologicallevels and thus be involved in ecosystem feedback loops.

TI  - Antiviral activity and underlying mechanisms of Baicalin against avian infectiousbronchitis virus in vitro.
PG  - 1-36
LID - 10.1080/03079457.2022.2109453 [doi]
AB  - Baicalin, a flavonoid compound extracted from the dry root of Scutellariabaicalensis Georgi, has been shown to have anti-inflammation, anti-viral,anti-bacterial, and immunomodulatory activity. However, the effect of baicalinagainst avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains unknown. The purpose ofthis study was to investigate the anti-IBV activity and underlying mechanism ofbaicalin in vitro. The results showed that baicalin has a direct virucidal effectbut no prophylactic effect on IBV infection. The mRNA and protein of IBV N weredecreased obviously when IBV-infected cells were treated with baicalin during themultiple stages of the virus replication cycle, including viral adsorption,invasion, internalization, and release. Stress granule (SG) formation resultedfrom the increase of G3BP1 and the phosphorylation of the PKR/eIF2alpha due tothe treatment of IBV-infected cells with baicalin. The inhibitory activity ofbaicalin on IBV replication was increased when G3BP1 expression was inhibited,and the down-regulation of G3BP1 expression occurred when the expression of PKRand eIF2alpha was inhibited. These findings revealed that baicalin activatesphosphorylation of PKR/eIF2alpha pathway and induces SG formation by targetingG3BP1, initiating the antiviral response to suppress IBV replication on Verocell. The results suggest that baicalin is a promising candidate drug to treat orprevent IBV infection.

TI  - Association of Receiving a Fourth Dose of the BNT162b Vaccine With SARS-CoV-2Infection Among Health Care Workers in Israel.
PG  - e2224657
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24657 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Despite the high 3-dose vaccination rate among health care workers(HCWs) in Israel, a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in this groupwas observed during the Omicron wave. As a result, the Israeli Ministry of Healthdecided to recommend a fourth vaccine dose to medical staff. Objective: Toevaluate the benefit of a fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose on the breakthroughinfection rate among HCWs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicentercohort study was performed in January 2022, the first month of the 4-dosevaccination campaign, during a surge of the Omicron variant wave. All health careworkers at 11 general hospitals in Israel who had been vaccinated with 3 doses upto September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccinationcampaign were included. Exposures: Vaccination with a fourth dose of the BNT162b2vaccine during January 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Breakthrough COVID-19infections in 4-dose recipients vs 3-dose recipients measured by a polymerasechain reaction test result positive for SARS-CoV-2. Health care workers weretested based on symptoms or exposure. Results: A total of 29611 Israeli HCWs(19381 [65%] female; mean [SD] age, 44 [12] years) had received 3 vaccine dosesbetween August and September 2021; of these, 5331 (18%) received the fourth dose in January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination.Overall breakthrough infection rates were 368 of 5331 (7%) in the 4-dose groupand 4802 of 24280 (20%) in the 3-dose group (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI,0.32-0.39). Similar reductions were found in a matched analysis by the exact day of receiving the third vaccine (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71) and in a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.50-0.63). In both groups, no severe disease or death occurred.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine doseresulted in a reduced breakthrough infection rate among hospital staff. Thisreduction was lower than that observed after the third dose; nevertheless,considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to criticalmedical staff shortages, a fourth vaccine dose should be considered to mitigatethe infection rate among HCWs.

PG  - e2224897
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24897 [doi]
AB  - Importance: In combination with a decreased risk of AIDS-defining cancers andimproved survival of people infected with HIV, the burden of non-AIDS-definingcancer has increased markedly. Although a substantial number of studies havemeasured the cancer risk among people with HIV in developed countries, littleresearch has been conducted on the risk of cancer in HIV-infected people in Asia.Objective: To examine the cancer incidence and the estimated risk of cancer amongpeople in Korea infected with HIV compared with the general population. Design,Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study evaluated patientswithout cancer newly diagnosed with HIV from January 1, 2006, to December 31,2018, using a nationwide population-based claims database embedded in theNational Health Insurance Service database. Data were analyzed between December6, 2021, and February 28, 2022. Exposures: Infection with HIV. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer incidence and standardized incidence rate (SIR) through indirectstandardization. Results: A total of 11552 individuals without cancer (10444 male[90.4%]; mean [SD] age, 39.9 [11.2] years) diagnosed with HIV were identified.The SIR for all cancers was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.50-1.87) in men and 1.26 (95% CI,0.89-1.64) in women. In men, the highest SIRs were for Kaposi sarcoma (SIR,349.10; 95% CI, 196.10-502.20) and anal cancer (SIR, 104.20; 95% CI,55.56-149.90). The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 15.62; 95% CI,11.85-19.39), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 16.67; 95% CI, 4.32-29.02), andoropharyngeal cancer (SIR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.36-4.58) in men infected with HIV was higher than in the general population. In women infected with HIV, an increasedincidence of cervical cancer (SIR, 4.98; 95% CI, 1.29-8.66) and non-Hodgkinlymphoma (SIR, 11.78; 95% CI, 2.35-21.21) compared with the general populationwas observed. The SIR of thyroid cancer in patients with HIV was lower than inthe general population in both men (SIR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.27-0.99) and women (SIR,0.48; 95% CI, 0.06-0.90). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, cancerrisks, especially AIDS-defining cancer and virus-related cancer, were elevated inpeople with HIV. Efforts for cancer prevention, screening, and betteraccessibility to medical care in HIV-infected people are warranted.

TI  - Rapid and quantitative detection of multiple antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 mutantproteins by photo-immobilized microarray.
LID - 10.1007/s44211-022-00161-z [doi]
AB  - A rapid automatic quantitative diagnostic system for multiple SARS-CoV-2 mutantprotein-specific antibodies was developed using a microarray with photoreactivepolymers. Two types of photoreactive polymers, phenylazide and polyoxyethylene,were prepared. The polymers were coated on a plastic plate. Aqueous solutions of mutant virus proteins were microspotted on the coated plate and immobilized byphotoirradiation. Virus-specific IgG in the serum or blood was automaticallyassayed using an instrument that we developed for pipetting, reagent stirring,and washing. The results highly correlated with those of the conventionalenzyme-linked immunoassay or immunochromatography. This system was successfullyused to test the sera or blood from the patients recovered from the infection andthe vaccinated individuals. The recovered individuals had antibodies against the nucleoprotein, in contrast to the vaccinated individuals. The amount ofantibodies produced decreased with an increase in virus mutation. Blood collectedfrom the fingertip (5 muL) and a test period of 8 min were sufficient conditions for conducting multiple antibody assays. We believe that our system wouldfacilitate rapid and quantitative automatic assays and aid in the diagnosis ofvarious viral infectious diseases and assessment of the immune status forclinical applications.

TI  - A Review of In Silico Research, SARS-CoV-2, and Neurodegeneration: Focus onPapain-Like Protease.
LID - 10.1007/s12640-022-00542-2 [doi]
AB  - Since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for new approaches to treat this disease took place in the scientific community. The insilico approach has gained importance at this moment, once the methodologies usedin this kind of study allow for the identification of specific protein-ligandinteractions, which may serve as a filter step for molecules that can act asspecific inhibitors. In addition, it is a low-cost and high-speed technology.Molecular docking has been widely used to find potential viral protein inhibitorsfor structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, aiming to block theinfection and the virus multiplication. The papain-like protease (PLpro)participates in the proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV-2 and composes one of the main targets studied for pharmacological intervention by in silico methodologies.Based on that, we performed a systematic review about PLpro inhibitors from theperspective of in silico research, including possible therapeutic molecules inrelation to this viral protein. The neurological problems triggered by COVID-19were also briefly discussed, especially relative to the similarities ofneuroinflammation present in Alzheimer's disease. In this context, we focused on two molecules, curcumin and glycyrrhizinic acid, given their PLpro inhibitoryactions and neuroprotective properties and potential therapeutic effects onCOVID-19.

TI  - Epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment modalities of facial nerve palsyin COVID-19 patients: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s13760-022-02026-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for a wide varietyof multi-system clinical features. Facial nerve palsy (FNP) is identified as one of the neurological complications of the virus. This work aims to systematically review the clinical picture, laboratory/imaging findings, treatment options, and prognostic factors of FNP in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using six onlinedatabases, a search was conducted to include all articles with patients infected with COVID-19 and presenting with unilateral or bilateral FNP. Screening foreligibility and data extraction were done by three and four independentreviewers, respectively. Descriptive analyses and data visualizations were doneusing Google Sheets. Survival analysis and Kaplan-Meier plotting were done by Rsoftware. RESULTS: The data from 22 studies included 32 patients who wereinfected with COVID-19 and presented with clinical features of FNP. Fourteenpatients were male while 18 were female. FNP affected 29 patients unilaterallyand 3 patients bilaterally. The imaging findings confirmed that complications of FNP were COVID-19 related. Additionally, antivirals combined with steroids hadthe lowest median time (21, IQR = 8) to clinical improvement compared tosteroid-only (30, IQR = 15) and antiviral-only (33, IQR = 3.5) treatments.CONCLUSION: This study has shown a potential correlation between the increasedincidence of FNP and COVID-19. We have also found that combining antivirals with steroids may have better outcomes in patients with FNP and COVID-19 although the evidence to support this claim is not strong enough. Further studies are requiredto assess the extent of linkage between the two conditions and how to properlymanage FNP when encountered in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the different protective mechanisms of approvedvaccines, this study focuses on the comparison of humoral and cellular immuneresponses of five widely used vaccines including ChAdOx1 (AZD1222, AstraZeneca), BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), and Gam-COVID-Vac(Sputnik V). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated plasma from 95 volunteers' bloodsamples was used to measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immuneresponses. Positive controls were recovered patients from COVID-19(unvaccinated). Specific quantification kits for anti-nucleocapsid IgG,anti-Spike protein IgG, neutralizing antibodies as well as specific SARS-CoV-2antigens for T-cell activation were used and Spearman correlation and matrixanalyses were performed to compare overall immune responses. RESULTS:Nucleocapsid antibodies were significantly higher for the BBIBP-CorV andconvalescent group when compared to other vaccines. In contrast, subjectsvaccinated with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 presented significantly higher anti-spike IgG. In fact, 9.1% of convalescent, 4.5% of Gam-COVID-Vac, 28.6% of ChAdOx1, and 12.5% of BBIBP-CorV volunteers did not generate anti-spike IgG. Similarly, apositive correlation was observed after the neutralization assay. T-cellactivation studies showed that mRNA-based vaccines induced a T-cell driven immuneresponse in all cases, while 55% of convalescents, 8% of BNT162b1, 12,5% ofmRNA-1273, 9% of Gam-COVID-Vac, 57% of ChAdOx1, and 56% of BBIBP-CorV subjectspresented no cellular response. Further correlation matrix analyses indicatedthat anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies production, and T-cell activationfollow the same trend after immunization. CONCLUSIONS: RNA-based vaccines inducedthe most robust adaptive immune activation against SARS-CoV-2 by promoting asignificantly higher T-cell response, anti-spike IgG and neutralization levels.Vector-based vaccines protected against the virus at a comparable level toconvalescent patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic broke out,caused by the coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reinfections can be observed with various respiratory viruses,including human coronaviruses. Moreover, they may result from weak or waninginitial immune response, reinfection with another genotype/subtype, or the rapid antigenic changes in the virus. The aim of this study was to investigate thelikelihood of reinfection in COVID-19 patients that had a positive qPCR testresult at least 60 days after a negative test result in patients that wereconfirmed with COVID-19 on qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results of a total of 105,000 samples that hadbeen obtained between April 1, 2020, and February 1, 2021, in two separateauthorized laboratories were retrospectively analyzed. 22 samples from 11patients included in the study, qPCR tests were repeated for each sample usingthe Rotorgene Q PCR system with Diagnovital SARS-CoV-2 (RTA Labs, Turkey)Real-Time PCR kits. Positive samples were screened for B.1.1.7 and E484Kmutations using the qPCR method on the Rotorgene Q PCR system with Bio-SpeedySARS-CoV-2 Variant Plus kits (Bioeksen Technology, Turkey). RESULTS: The 105,000 individuals comprised 55,614 men and 49,386 women. In the qPCR test, 14,511(13.82%) individuals were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 11(0.076%) patients were included in the study based on the inclusion criteria.Accordingly, the risk of reinfection was calculated as 0.076% (95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 0.056%-0.096%) and the incidence was 1.04 per 10,000 population(95% CI: 0.62-1.38 per 10,000). No patient was admitted to the intensive careunit or died during both episodes. Moreover, no B.1.1.7 or E484K mutation wasdetected in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of COVID-19 infectionposes serious risks for the development of new variants and the currently usedvaccines are likely to lose their efficacy against new variants. To reduce these risks and to be successful in the fight against the pandemic, we suggestcompliance with personal protective measures as well as rapid and widespreadapplication of vaccination not only in developed countries but also in the whole world and the modification of currently used vaccines in such a way to fightagainst newly emerged variants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors that mayaffect the prognosis and length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients,particularly immunoglobulin A. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients admitted to therelevant department or intensive care unit with a diagnosis of COVID-19 betweenApril 2020 and January 2021 were included in the study. Demographiccharacteristics of the patients and blood type, immunoglobulin A (IgA),C-reactive protein, D-dimer, procalcitonin, ferritin, troponin I, complete blood count, biochemical, and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerasechain reaction test results were evaluated retrospectively from the hospitalfiles and data system. RESULTS: A total of 164 COVID-19 patients were included inthis study. The median age was 72 (range: 30-95) years and the genderdistribution of women and men was 66/98 (40.2% vs. 59.8%, respectively). Therewas no statistically significant relationship between blood type andhospitalization time or mortality (p=0.497 and p=0.923, respectively). There was furthermore no statistically significant relationship between Rh group and theduration of hospitalization or prognosis (p=0.198 and p=0.827, respectively).There was no statistically significant correlation between IgA level andhospitalization time or prognosis (p=0.066, r=0.144). In the analysis of defined risk factors independently associated with death, the following were found to be significant indicators of mortality: leukopenia [beta: -2.973, OR (95% CI): 0.051(0.003-0.891), p=0.041], glucose [beta: 0.014, OR (95% CI): 1.014 (1.001-1.028), p=0.037], D-dimer [beta: 0.001, OR (95% CI): 1.001 (1.000-1.001), p=0.023],duration of hospitalization [beta: -0.218, OR (95% CI): 0.804 (0.708-0.913),p=0.001], and duration of stay in the intensive care unit [beta: 0.348, OR (95%CI): 1.416 (1.186-1.690), p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, no relationshipwas found between IgA level and hospitalization time or mortality among COVID-19 patients. However, leukopenia and increased glucose, D-dimer, neutrophil count,urea, and durations of hospital and intensive care stays were found to beimportant predictors of mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vaccination is an important method for preventing COVID-19 infection. However, certain vaccines do not meet the current needs. To improve the vaccineeffect, discard ineffective antigens, and focus on high-quality antigenicclusters, S1-E bivalent antigens were designed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vaccinedelivery is performed using poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Here, therecombinant S1-E (rS1-E) was covered on PLGA and injected intramuscularly intomice. In total, 48 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups with 8 mice in each group. The mice received intramuscular injections. Prior to vaccination, the hydrophobicity of the rS1-E and the antigenic site of the E protein were bothanalysed. The morphology, zeta potential, and particle size distribution ofrS1-E-PLGA were examined. Anti-S1 and anti-E antibodies were detected in mouseserum by ELISA. Neutralising an-tibodies were detected by co-incubating thepseudovirus with the obtained serum. IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels were alsomeasured. RESULTS: The designed recombinant S1-E protein was successfully coated on PLGA nanoparticles. rS1-E-PLGA nanovaccine has suitable size, shape, goodstability, sustained release and other characteristics. Importantly, mice werestimulated with rS1-E-PLGA nanovaccines to produce high-titre antibodies and agood cellular immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that rS1-E-PLGA nanovaccine may provide a good protective effect, and the vaccine should befurther investigated in human clinical trials for use in vaccination or as abooster.

TI  - Study on aptamer based high throughput approach identifies natural ingredientsagainst RGNNV.
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13693 [doi]
AB  - Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) is one of the most destructive pathogens in marinefish aquaculture and is capable of infecting more than 50 fish species worldwide,which resulted in great economic losses. Effective drugs for managing NNVinfection are urgently required. Medicinal plants have been known for thousandsof years and benefit of medicinal plants against pathogens in aquaculture haveemerged. Nowadays, the most commonly used method for detecting virus infectionand assessing antiviral drugs efficacy is reverse transcription-quantitativereal-time PCR. However, the application is limited on account of high reagentcosts, complex time-consuming operations and long detection time. Aptamers havebeen widely applied in application of pathogens or diseases diagnosis andtreatments because of high specificity, strong affinity, good stability, easysynthesized and low costs. This study aimed to establish an aptamer (GBN34)-basedhigh-throughput screening (GBN34-AHTS) model for efficient selection andevaluation of natural ingredients against NNV infection. GBN34-AHTS is anexpeditious rapid method for selecting natural ingredients against NNV, which is characterized with high-speed, dram, sensitive and accurate. AHTS strategy could reduce work intensity and experimental costs and shorten the whole screeningcycle of effective ingredients. AHTS should be suitable for rapid selection ofeffective ingredients against other viruses, which is important for improving theprevention and controlling of aquatic diseases.

TI  - Effects of natural RNA modifications on the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
LID - 10.1111/febs.16587 [doi]
AB  - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays the key role in replication of RNAviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Processive RNA synthesis by RdRp is crucial forsuccessful genome replication and expression, especially in the case of very longcoronaviral genomes. Here, we analyzed the activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (thensp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex) on synthetic primer-templates of various structures,including substrates with mismatched primers or template RNA modifications. Ithas been shown that RdRp cannot efficiently extend RNA primers containingmismatches and has no intrinsic RNA cleavage activity to remove the primer3'-end, thus necessitating the action of exoribonuclease for proofreading.Similarly to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RdRp can perform processivepyrophosphorolysis of the nascent RNA product but this reaction is also blockedin the presence of mismatches. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that naturalpost-transcriptional modifications in the RNA template that do not preventcomplementary interactions (N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, inosine andpseudouridine) do not change RdRp processivity. At the same time, certainmodifications of RNA bases and ribose residues strongly block RNA synthesis,either prior to nucleotide incorporation (3-methyluridine, 1-methylguanosine) or immediately after it (2'-O-methylation). The results demonstrate that theactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can be strongly inhibited by common modifications of the RNA template suggesting a way for design of novel antiviral compounds.

TI  - Longitudinal monitoring of BKPyV miRNA levels in kidney transplant recipientswith BKPyV related pathology reflects viral DNA levels and remain high in viremiapatients after clearance of viral DNA.
LID - 10.1111/tid.13927 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether polyomavirus BK (BKPyV) miRNA measurement hasadditional diagnostic and predictive value in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) as compared to current methods of monitoring BKPyV DNA loads. PATIENTS ANDMETHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was performed in 30 KTR with BKPyVviruria (n = 10), BKPyV viremia (n = 10) or BKPyVAN (n = 10). Bkv-miR-B1-3p, 5pand BKPyV DNA-load were measured in urine and plasma and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Levels of Bkv-miR-B1-3p and 5pand BKPyV DNA correlated strongly. Overall, mostly analogue courses of urinaryand plasma miRNA and DNA loads were observed. Areas under the ROC curves were notsignificantly different between miRNAs and DNA. Only, in contrast to BKPyV DNAload, BKPyV miRNA levels increased from 6 to 12 months in the viremia group,while in the BKPyVAN group a decline was seen in both DNA and miRNA. CONCLUSIONS:In this study we could not demonstrate an additional value of BKPyV miRNAdetection compared to BKPyV DNA monitoring in the early phase after kidneytransplantation. We did observe significant differences between the viremia andthe BKPyVAN groups during follow up. This study was performed with a small numberof patients and therefore results should be verified in a larger patient cohort. Furthermore, future studies with larger patient groups are necessary to elucidatefinal clinical value of these data. This article is protected by copyright. Allrights reserved.

TI  - Identification of NS5B Resistance against SOFOSBUVIR in Hepatitis C VirusGenotype 3a, naive and treated Patients.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15754 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Pakistan has the second highest prevalence of HCV with genotype 3a (GT-3a) being the most frequently circulating genotype. Currently resistance associatedsubstitutions (RASs) are a major challenge in HCV treatment with direct actingantivirals (DAAs). Sofosbuvir (SOF) is an FDA-approved NS5B nucleotide inhibitor.The aim of this study was to identify these RASs in the NS5B gene in naive andtreated Pakistani HCV 3a isolates against SOF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood sampleswere collected from anti-HCV positive patients, followed by HCV RNA isolation andreal time PCR quantification. HCV positive patients were processed for HCV RNAgenotyping, Patients with genotype 3a were processed for NS5B gene amplification and sequencing. GT-3a was the most prevalent genotype (62.2%). S282T wasidentified in 2 (8.7%) patients, C316Y/G/R in 3 (13%), V321A, and L320P in 1(4.3%) each in SOF/RBV resistant patients. Variants of S282 were detected in 3(13%) of SOF/RBV treated patients. While INF/RBV associated mutations were alsoanalyzed, D244N, A333R, and A334E were identified in 2 (9.5%), 3 (14.2%), and 7(33.3%) in treatment-naive and 15 (65.2%), 7 (30.4%), and 5 (21.7%) treatedpatients respectively. Q309R was observed only in one treatment experiencedpatients. Some substitutions were present at higher frequency in both groups likeN307G, K304R, A272D and R345H, considered that they do not have any role inSofosbuvir resistance. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that Sofosbuvir RASs arepresent in Pakistani HCV GT-3a isolates, and they should be monitored carefully, especially in treatment-experienced patients, for further selection of treatment regimens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: HCV RASs have been studied very well across the world but there is scarcity of data regarding this topic in Pakistani population, this study provides data regarding prevalence of these RASs inPakistani HCV isolates emphasizing the fact that these RASs must be carefullymonitored before starting HCV treatment especially in treatment failure patients.

AB  - Scientific literature about the ongoing COVID-19 disease and pandemic isconsiderable, though articles concentrate on the severe cases and their centralnervous system manifestations. This article demonstrates two cases: middle-agedfemale patients who had serologically proven SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild upperairway and central nervous system symptoms. The patients reported vivid, strange,simple, and complex visual and auditory hallucinations. A characteristic element of these complex hallucinations was a talking human-shaped figure. Only threesimilar cases have been published; this article discusses common features of all five patients. This summary highlights that in COVID-19 cases, minor centralnervous system symptoms can accompany mild or even missing upper respiratorysymptoms. The cranial MRIs of the presented patients were normal, but the EEGshowed focal abnormalities in localizations related to hallucinations, whichemphasizes the importance of EEG in differential diagnostic procedures.

TI  - Porcine Deltacoronavirus Infection Cleaves HDAC2 to Attenuate Its AntiviralActivity.
PG  - e0102722
LID - 10.1128/jvi.01027-22 [doi]
AB  - Protein acetylation plays an important role during virus infection. Thus, it isnot surprising that viruses always evolve elaborate mechanisms to regulate thefunctions of histone deacetylases (HDACs), the essential transcriptional andepigenetic regulators for deacetylation. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), anemerging enteropathogenic coronavirus, causes severe diarrhea in suckling pigletsand has the potential to infect humans. In this study, we found that PDCoVinfection inhibited cellular HDAC activity. By screening the expressions ofdifferent HDAC subfamilies after PDCoV infection, we unexpectedly found thatHDAC2 was cleaved. Ectopic expression of HDAC2 significantly inhibited PDCoVreplication, while the reverse effects could be observed after treatment with an HDAC2 inhibitor (CAY10683) or the knockdown of HDAC2 expression by specificsiRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDCoV-encoded nonstructural protein 5(nsp5), a 3C-like protease, was responsible for HDAC2 cleavage through itsprotease activity. Detailed analyses showed that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved HDAC2 atglutamine 261 (Q261), and the cleaved fragments (amino acids 1 to 261 and 262 to 488) lost the ability to inhibit PDCoV replication. Interestingly, the Q261cleavage site is highly conserved in HDAC2 homologs from other mammalian species,and the nsp5s encoded by seven tested mammalian coronaviruses also cleaved HDAC2,suggesting that cleaving HDAC2 may be a common strategy used by differentmammalian coronaviruses to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. IMPORTANCE As an emerging porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus that possesses the potential to infect humans, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is receiving increasingattention. In this work, we found that PDCoV infection downregulated cellularhistone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Of particular interest, the viral 3C-likeprotease, encoded by the PDCoV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), cleaved HDAC2, andthis cleavage could be observed in the context of PDCoV infection. Furthermore,the cleavage of HDAC2 appears to be a common strategy among mammaliancoronaviruses, including the emerging severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. To ourknowledge, PDCoV nsp5 is the first identified viral protein that can cleavecellular HDAC2. Results from our study provide new targets to develop drugscombating coronavirus infection.

TI  - Differential Recognition of Computationally Optimized H3 Hemagglutinin Influenza Vaccine Candidates by Human Antibodies.
PG  - e0089622
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00896-22 [doi]
AB  - Among circulating influenza viruses in humans, H3N2 viruses typically evolvefaster than other subtypes and have caused disease in millions of people sinceemerging in 1968. Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA)technology is one strategy to broaden vaccine-elicited antibody responses amonginfluenza subtypes. In this study, we determined the structural integrity of anH3N2 COBRA hemagglutinin (HA), TJ5, and we probed the antigenic profile ofseveral H3N2 COBRA HAs by assessing recognition of these immunogens by human Bcells from seasonally vaccinated human subjects. Of three recently describedCOBRA H3 HA antigens (TJ5, NG2, and J4), we determined that TJ5 and J4 HAproteins recognize pre-existing B cells more effectively than NG2 HA and awild-type Hong Kong/4801/2014 protein. We also isolated a panel of 12 H3HA-specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and identified that most MAbsrecognize both wild-type and COBRA HA proteins and have functional activityagainst a broad panel of H3N2 viruses. Most MAbs target the receptor-bindingsite, and one MAb targets the HA stem. MAb TJ5-5 recognizes TJ5 and J4 COBRA HAproteins but has poor recognition of NG2 HA, similar to the global B-cellanalysis. We determined a 3.4 A structure via cryo-electron microscopy of FabTJ5-5 complexed with the H3 COBRA TJ5, which revealed residues important to thedifferential binding. Overall, these studies determined that COBRA H3 HA proteinshave correct antigenic and structural features, and the proteins are recognizedby B cells and MAbs isolated from seasonally vaccinated humans. IMPORTANCEVaccine development for circulating influenza viruses, particularly for the H3N2 subtype, remains challenging due to consistent antigenic drift. Computationallyoptimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) technology has proven effective forbroadening influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-elicited antibody responses compared towild-type immunogens. Here, we determined the structural features and antigenicprofiles of H3 COBRA HA proteins. Two H3 COBRA HA proteins, TJ5 and J4, arebetter recognized by pre-existing B cells and monoclonal antibodies from the 2017to 2018 vaccine season compared to COBRA NG2 and a wild-type A/Hong Kong/2014 HA protein. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of one MAb that poorly recognizes NG2, MAb TJ5-5, in complex with the TJ5 COBRA HA proteinand identified residues critical to MAb recognition. As NG2 is more effectivethan TJ5 for the recent Hong Kong/2019 virus, these data provide insights intothe diminished effectiveness of influenza vaccines across vaccine seasons.

TI  - Markers of Immune Activation and Inflammation Are Associated with Higher Levelsof Genetically-Intact HIV in HIV-HBV Co-Infected Individuals.
PG  - e0058822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00588-22 [doi]
AB  - Co-infection with hepatitis B (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)increases overall and liver-related mortality. In order to identify interactions between these two viruses in vivo, full-length HIV proviruses were sequenced froma cohort of HIV-HBV co-infected participants and from a cohort of HIVmono-infected participants recruited from Bangkok, Thailand, both before theinitiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and after at least 2 years of ART. Theco-infected individuals were found to have higher levels of genetically-intactHIV proviruses than did mono-infected individuals pre-therapy. In theseco-infected individuals, higher levels of genetically-intact HIV proviruses orproviral genetic-diversity were also associated with higher levels of sCD14 andCXCL10, suggesting that immune activation is linked to more genetically-intactHIV proviruses. Three years of ART decreased the overall level of HIV proviruses,with fewer genetically-intact proviruses being identified in co-infected versusmono-infected individuals. However, ART increased the frequency of certaingenetic defects within proviruses and the expansion of identical HIV sequences.IMPORTANCE With the increased availability and efficacy of ART, co-morbiditiesare now one of the leading causes of death in HIV-positive individuals. One ofthese co-morbidities is co-infection with HBV. However, co-infections are stillrelatively understudied, especially in countries where such co-infections areendemic. Furthermore, these countries have different subtypes of HIV circulating than the commonly studied HIV subtype B. We believe that our study serves thisunderstudied niche and provides a novel approach to investigating the impact ofHBV co-infection on HIV infection. We examine co-infection at the molecular levelin order to investigate indirect associations between the two viruses throughtheir interactions with the immune system. We demonstrate that increased immuneinflammation and activation in HBV co-infected individuals is associated withhigher HIV viremia and an increased number of genetically-intact HIV provirusesin peripheral blood cells. This leads us to hypothesize that inflammation couldbe a driver in the increased mortality rate of HIV-HBV co-infected individuals.

AB  - Prior studies have demonstrated prolonged presence of yellow fever virus (YFV)RNA in saliva and urine as an alternative to serum. To investigate the presenceof YFV RNA in urine, we used RT-PCR for YFV screening in 60 urine samplescollected from a large cohort of naturally infected yellow fever (YF) patientsduring acute and convalescent phases of YF infection from recent YF outbreaks in Brazil (2017 to 2018). Fifteen urine samples from acute phase infection (up to 15days post-symptom onset) and four urine samples from convalescent phase infection(up to 69 days post-symptom onset), were YFV PCR-positive. We genotyped YFVdetected in seven urine samples (five collected during the acute phase and twocollected during the YF convalescent phase). Genotyping indicated the presence ofYFV South American I genotype in these samples. To our knowledge, this is thefirst report of wild-type YFV RNA detection in the urine this far out fromsymptom onset (up to 69 DPS), including YFV RNA detection during the convalescentphase of YF infection. The detection of YFV RNA in urine is an indicative of YFV infection; however, the results of RT-PCR using urine as sample should beinterpreted with care, since a negative result does not exclude the possibilityof YFV infection. With a possible prolonged period of detection beyond theviremic phase, the use of urine samples coupled with serological tests,epidemiologic inquiry, and clinical assessment could provide a longer diagnostic window for laboratory YF diagnosis.

TI  - Induction of Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlates with Reduced Growth ofInfluenza A Virus in Lungs after RIG-I Agonist Treatment of Ferrets.
PG  - e0055922
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00559-22 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular RIG-I receptors represent key innate sensors of RNA virusinfection, and RIG-I activation results in the induction of hundreds of hosteffector genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Synthetic RNAagonists targeting RIG-I have shown promise as antivirals against a broadspectrum of viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), in both in vitro andmouse models of infection. Herein, we demonstrate that treatment of a ferretairway epithelial (FRL) cell line with a RIG-I agonist rapidly and potentlyinduced expression of a broad range of ISGs and resulted in potent inhibition of growth of different IAV strains. In ferrets, a single intravenous injection ofRIG-I agonist was associated with upregulated ISG expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lung tissue, but not in nasal tissues. In a ferret model ofviral contact transmission, a single treatment of recipient animals 24 h prior tocohousing with IAV-infected donors did not reduce virus transmission and sheddingbut did result in reduced lung virus titers 6 days after treatment. A singletreatment of the IAV-infected donor animals also resulted in reduced virus titersin the lungs 2 days later. Thus, a single intravenous treatment with RIG-Iagonist prior to infection or to ferrets with an established IAV infection canreduce virus growth in the lungs. These findings support further development ofRIG-I agonists as effective antiviral treatments to limit the impact of IAVinfections, particularly in reducing virus replication in the lower airways.IMPORTANCE RIG-I agonists have shown potential as broad-spectrum antivirals invitro and in mouse models of infection. However, their antiviral potential hasnot been reported in outbred animals such as ferrets, which are widely regardedas the gold standard small animal model for human IAV infections. Herein, wedemonstrate that RIG-I agonist treatment of a ferret airway cell line resulted inISG induction and inhibition of a broad range of human influenza viruses. Asingle intravenous treatment of ferrets also resulted in systemic induction ofISGs, including in lung tissue, and when delivered to animals prior to IAVexposure or to animals with established IAV infection treatment resulted inreduced virus replication in the lungs. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of single RIG-I treatment against IAV in the ferret model and highlight theimportance of future studies to optimize treatment regimens and delivery routesto maximize their ability to ameliorate IAV infections.

TI  - Immune Escape Adaptive Mutations in Hemagglutinin Are Responsible for theAntigenic Drift of Eurasian Avian-Like H1N1 Swine Influenza Viruses.
PG  - e0097122
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00971-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous antigenic variation of influenza A viruses remains a major hurdle for vaccine selection; however, the molecular determinants and mechanisms ofantigenic change remain largely unknown. In this study, two escape mutants weregenerated by serial passages of the Eurasian avian-like H1N1 swine influenzavirus (EA H1N1 SIV) A/swine/Henan/11/2005 (HeN11) in the presence of twoneutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the hemagglutinin (HA) protein,which were designated HeN11-2B6-P5 and HeN11-4C7-P8, respectively. TheHeN11-2B6-P5 mutant simultaneously harbored the N190D and I230M substitutions in HA, whereas HeN11-4C7-P8 harbored the M269R substitution in HA (H3 numbering).The effects of each of these substitutions on viral antigenicity were determined by measuring the neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers with mAbs and polyclonal sera raised against the representative viruses. The resultsindicate that residues 190 and 269 are key determinants of viral antigenicvariation. In particular, the N190D mutation had the greatest antigenic impact,as determined by the HI assay. Further studies showed that both HeN11-2B6-P5 and HeN11-4C7-P8 maintained the receptor-binding specificity of the parent virus,although the single mutation N190D decreased the binding affinity for thehuman-type receptor. The replicative ability in vitro of HeN11-2B6-P5 wasincreased, whereas that of HeN11-4C7-P8 was decreased. These findings extend our understanding of the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses under immunepressure and provide insights into the functional effects of amino acidsubstitutions near the receptor-binding site and the interplay among receptorbinding, viral replication, and antigenic drift. IMPORTANCE The antigenic changesthat occur continually in the evolution of influenza A viruses remain a greatchallenge for the effective control of disease outbreaks. Here, we identifiedthree amino acid substitutions (at positions 190, 230, and 269) in the HA of EAH1N1 SIVs that determine viral antigenicity and result in escape fromneutralizing monoclonal antibodies. All three of these substitutions have emergedin nature. Of note, residues 190 and 230 have synergistic effects on receptorbinding and antigenicity. Our findings provide a better understanding of thefunctional effects of amino acid substitutions in HA and their consequences forthe antigenic drift of influenza viruses.

TI  - A Bispecific Antibody Targeting RBD and S2 Potently Neutralizes SARS-CoV-2Omicron and Other Variants of Concern.
PG  - e0077522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00775-22 [doi]
AB  - Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)variants, especially the Omicron variant, have impaired the efficacy of existing vaccines and most therapeutic antibodies, highlighting the need for additionalantibody-based tools that can efficiently neutralize emerging SARS-CoV-2variants. The use of a "single" agent to simultaneously target multiple distinct epitopes on the spike is desirable in overcoming the neutralizing escape ofSARS-CoV-2 variants. Herein, we generated a human-derived IgG-like bispecificantibody (bsAb), Bi-Nab35B5-47D10, which successfully retained parentalspecificity and simultaneously bound to the two distinct epitopes onreceptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2. Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 showed improved spikebinding breadth among wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern (VOCs), and variants being monitored (VBMs) compared with its parental monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Furthermore, pseudotyped virus neutralization demonstrated thatBi-Nab35B5-47D10 can efficiently neutralize VBMs, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta(B.1.351), and Kappa (B.1.617.1), as well as VOCs, including Delta (B.1.617.2),Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2. Crucially, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 substantiallyimproved neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1 (IC50 = 0.15 nM) and Omicron BA.2 (IC50 = 0.67 nM) compared with its parental MAbs. Therefore,Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 represents a potential effective countermeasure againstSARS-CoV-2 Omicron and other variants of concern. IMPORTANCE The new, highlycontagious SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant caused substantial breakthrough infections and has become the dominant strain in countries across the world. Omicronvariants usually bear high mutations in the spike protein and exhibitconsiderable escape of most potent neutralization monoclonal antibodies andreduced efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines. The development of neutralizingantibodies with potent efficacy against the Omicron variant is still an urgentpriority. Here, we generated a bsAb, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10, which simultaneouslytargets SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S2 and improves the neutralizing potency and breadthagainst SARS-CoV-2 WT and the tested variants compared with their parentalantibodies. Notably, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 has more potent neutralizing activityagainst the VOC Omicron pseudotyped virus. Therefore, Bi-Nab35B5-47D10 is afeasible and potentially effective strategy by which to treat and preventCOVID-19.

TI  - Minding the Matrix: The Importance of Inoculum Suspensions on Finger TransferEfficiency of Virus.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15758 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine how transfer efficiency of MS-2coliphage from toilet seat to hands and fingertip to lip differs according to thesuspension of the inoculum. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hands were sampled after liftinga toilet seat which was inoculated with MS-2 on the underneath side. MS-2 wassuspended in a spectrum of proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous solutions.Transfer efficiencies were greatest with the ASTM tripartite soil load (3.02% +/-4.03) and lowest with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (1.10% +/- 0.81) forhand-to-toilet seat contacts. Finger-to-lip transfer rates were significantlydifferent (p < 0.05) depending on suspension matrix, with PBS yielding thehighest transfer (52.53% +/- 4.48%) and tryptose soy broth (TSB) the lowest(23.15% +/- 24.27%). Quantitative microbial risk assessment was used to estimate probability of infection from adenovirus and norovirus from finger contact with atoilet seat. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest transfer as well as the largest variation of transfer were measured for finger-to-lip contacts as opposed to toiletseat-to-finger contacts. These factors influence the estimation of probability ofinfection from micro-activity i.e., toilet seat adjustment. SIGNIFICANCE ANDIMPACT: Viruses may be transferred from various human excreta with differingtransfer efficiencies, depending on the protein content.

AB  - COVID-19 has emerged as the biggest pandemic of the world of all times. Its deathtoll is rising globally. COVID-19 mostly affects the lungs because the virusenters the host cells via the receptor for the ACE2 enzyme, which is also presentin other organs of the human body. ACE2 plays the main role in the degradation ofAng II, resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) which maintainsthe level of Ang II. This communication gives an assessment of reproductivesystem functioning and its effects by the COVID-19 exposure. It is important tomaintain the wellbeing for healthy nourishment of the fetus and safe deliveryalong with post health issues. ACE2 enzyme metabolism is expressed in the female reproductive system, and it may be potential target of COVID-19 exposure.

AB  - Phlebotomus chinensis sandfly is a neglected insect vector in China which iswell-known for carrying Leishmania. Recent studies have expanded its pathogenrepertoire with two novel arthropod-borne phleboviruses capable of infectinghuman and animals. Despite these discoveries, our knowledge on the generalpathogen diversity and overall microbiome composition of this vector species are still very limited. Here we carried out a meta-transcriptomics analysis whichsimultaneously revealed the actively replicating/transcribing RNA viruses, DNAviruses, bacteria and eukaryotic microbes, namely, "total microbiome", of severalsandfly populations in China. Strikingly, "microbiome" made up 1.8% of totalnon-ribosomal RNA and were comprised of more than 87 species, among which 70 werenovel, including divergent members of the genera Flavivirus and of the familyTrypanosomatidae. Importantly, among these microbes we were able to reveal fourdistinguished types of human and/or mammalian pathogens, including twophleboviruses (hedi and wuxiang viruses), one novel Spotted fever grouprickettsia, as well as a member of Leishmania donovani complex, among which hedi virus and Leishmania each had > 50% pool prevalence rate and relatively highabundance levels. Our study also showed the ubiquitous presence of anendosymbiont, namely Wolbachia, although no anti-viral or anti-pathogen effectwere detected based on our data. In summary, our results uncovered the muchun-explored diversity of microbes harbored by sandflies in China and demonstratedthat high pathogen diversity and abundance is currently present in multiplepopulations, implying disease potential for exposed local human population ordomestic animals.

TI  - Virome of Giant Panda-Infesting Ticks Reveals Novel Bunyaviruses and OtherViruses That Are Genetically Close to Those from Giant Pandas.
PG  - e0203422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02034-22 [doi]
AB  - Tick infestations have been reported as one of the factors threatening the healthof giant pandas, but studies of viral pathogens carried by ticks feeding on theblood of giant pandas are limited. To assess whether blood-sucking ticks of giantpandas can carry viral pathogens and if so, whether the viruses in ticks areassociated with those previously detected in giant panda hosts, we determined theviromes of ticks detached from giant pandas in a field stocking area in SichuanProvince, southwest China. Using viral metagenomics we identified 32 viralspecies in ticks, half of which (including anellovirus [n = 9], circovirus [n =3], and gemycircularvirus [n = 4]) showed homology to viruses carried by giantpandas and their associated host species (such as red pandas and mosquitoes) inthe same living domain. Remarkably, several viruses in this studyphylogenetically assigned as bunyavirus, hepe-like virus, and circovirus weredetected with relatively high abundance, but whether these newly identifiedtick-associated viruses can replicate in ticks and then transmit to host animals during a blood meal will require further investigation. These findings furtherexpand our understanding of the role of giant panda-infesting ticks in the local ecosystem, especially related to viral acquisition and transmission, and lay afoundation to assess the risk for giant panda exposure to tick-borne viruses.IMPORTANCE Ticks rank only second to mosquitoes as blood-feeding arthropods,capable of spreading pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, and parasites) tohosts during a blood meal. To better understand the relationship between viruses carried by ticks and viruses that have been reported in giant pandas, it isnecessary to analyze the viromes of giant panda-parasitic blood-sucking ticks.This study collected 421 ticks on the body surface of giant pandas in SichuanProvince, China. We characterized the extensive genetic diversity of virusesharbored by these ticks and reported frequent communication of viruses betweengiant pandas and their ticks. While most of the virome discovered here arenonpathogenic viruses from giant pandas and potentially tick-specific viruses, werevealed some possible tick-borne viruses, represented by novel bunyaviruses.This research contributes to the literature because currently there are fewstudies on the virome of giant panda-infesting ticks.

TI  - A Variant Allele in Varicella-Zoster Virus Glycoprotein B Selected duringProduction of the Varicella Vaccine Contributes to Its Attenuation.
PG  - e0186422
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01864-22 [doi]
AB  - Attenuation of the live varicella Oka vaccine (vOka) has been attributed tomutations in the genome acquired during cell culture passage of pOka (parentstrain); however, the precise mechanisms of attenuation remain unknown.Comparative sequence analyses of several vaccine batches showed that over 100single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are conserved across all vaccine batches; 6 SNPs are nearly fixed, suggesting that these SNPs are responsible forattenuation. By contrast, prior analysis of chimeric vOka and pOka recombinantsindicates that loci other than these six SNPs contribute to attenuation. Here, wereport that pOka consists of a heterogenous population of virus sequences withtwo nearly equally represented bases, guanine (G) or adenine (A), at nucleotide2096 of the ORF31 coding sequence, which encodes glycoprotein B (gB) resulting inarginine (R) or glutamine (Q), respectively, at amino acid 699 of gB. Bycontrast, 2096A/699Q is dominant in vOka (>99.98%). gB699Q/gH/gL showedsignificantly less fusion activity than gB699R/gH/gL in a cell-based fusionassay. Recombinant pOka with gB669Q (rpOka_gB699Q) had a similar growth phenotypeas vOka during lytic infection in cell culture including human primary skincells; however, rpOka_gB699R showed a growth phenotype similar to pOka.rpOka_gB699R entered neurons from axonal terminals more efficiently thanrpOka_gB699Q in the presence of cell membrane-derived vesicles containing gB.Strikingly, when a mixture of pOka with both alleles equally represented was usedto infect human neurons from axon terminals, pOka with gB699R was dominant forvirus entry. These results identify a variant allele in gB that contributes toattenuation of vOka. IMPORTANCE The live-attenuated varicella vaccine has reducedthe burden of chickenpox. Despite its development in 1974, the molecular basisfor its attenuation is still not well understood. Since the live-attenuatedvaricella vaccine is the only licensed human herpesvirus vaccine that preventsprimary disease, it is important to understand the mechanism for its attenuation.Here we identify that a variant allele in glycoprotein B (gB) selected duringgeneration of the varicella vaccine contributes to its attenuation. This variant is impaired for fusion, virus entry into neurons from nerve terminals, andreplication in human skin cells. Identification of a variant allele in gB, one ofthe essential herpesvirus core genes, that contributes to its attenuation mayprovide insights that assist in the development of other herpesvirus vaccines.

LID - 10.7554/eLife.73896 [doi]
LID - e73896 [pii]
AB  - Tracking the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using phylogenetics has proven critical to inform the timing and stringency of COVID-19 public healthinterventions. We investigated the effectiveness of international travelrestrictions at reducing SARS-CoV-2 importations and transmission in Canada inthe first two waves of 2020 and early 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic treeswere used to infer viruses' geographic origins, enabling identification of 2263(95% confidence interval: 2159-2366) introductions, including 680 (658-703)Canadian sublineages, which are international introductions resulting in sampled Canadian descendants, and 1582 (1501-1663) singletons, introductions with nosampled descendants. Of the sublineages seeded during the first wave, 49%(46-52%) originated from the USA and were primarily introduced into Quebec (39%) and Ontario (36%), while in the second wave, the USA was still the predominantsource (43%), alongside a larger contribution from India (16%) and the UK (7%).Following implementation of restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals on 21 March 2020, importations declined from 58.5 (50.4-66.5) sublineages per week to10.3-fold (8.3-15.0) lower within 4 weeks. Despite the drastic reduction in viralimportations following travel restrictions, newly seeded sublineages in summerand fall 2020 contributed to the persistence of COVID-19 cases in the secondwave, highlighting the importance of sustained interventions to reducetransmission. Importations rebounded further in November, bringing newly emergentvariants of concern (VOCs). By the end of February 2021, there had been anestimated 30 (19-41) B.1.1.7 sublineages imported into Canada, which increasinglydisplaced previously circulating sublineages by the end of the secondwave.Although viral importations are nearly inevitable when global prevalence is high, with fewer importations there are fewer opportunities for novel variants tospark outbreaks or outcompete previously circulating lineages.

TI  - Long-Term Fine Particulate Matter Concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence:Differential Relationships by Socioeconomic Status Among Pregnant Individuals in New York City.

AB  - We aimed to determine if long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrationsare associated with increased risk of testing positive for COVID-19 amongpregnant individuals who were universally screened at delivery and ifsocioeconomic status (SES) modifies this relationship. We used obstetric datafrom Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City fromMarch-December 2020, which included Medicaid use (low-SES surrogate) andcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test results. We linked 300m resolutionestimated 2018-2019 PM2.5 concentrations and census tract-level populationdensity, household size and income, and mobility estimates. Analyses included3318 individuals; 5% tested positive for COVID-19 at delivery, 8% tested positiveduring pregnancy, 48% used Medicaid, and average long-term PM2.5 concentrationswere 7.4 mug/m3 (SD = 0.8). In adjusted multilevel logistic regression models, wesaw no association between PM2.5 and ever-testing positive for COVID-19; however,odds were elevated among those using Medicaid (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0, 2.5 per 1-mug/m3 increase). Further, while only 22% of those testing positive showed symptoms, 69% of symptomatic individuals used Medicaid. SES, including unmeasuredoccupational exposures or increased susceptibility to the virus due to co-social and environmental exposures, may explain the increased odds of testing positivefor COVID-19 confined to vulnerable pregnant individuals using Medicaid.

PG  - 443-449
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000859 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) has significantmorbidity and UGIB cases have been described in coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) patients. Management of this condition can be challenging considering both the possible severe COVID-19-related pneumonia as well as the risk of thevirus spreading from patients to health operators. The aim of this paper is toreview the most recent studies available in the literature in order to evaluatethe actual incidence of UGIB, its clinical and endoscopic manifestations and its optimal management. RECENT FINDINGS: UGIB has an incidence between 0.5% and 1.9% among COVID-19 patients, and it typically presents with melena or hematemesis.Peptic ulcers are the most common endoscopic findings. High Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), dialysis, acute kidney injury and advanced oncological diseaseincrease the risk for UGIB. Although anticoagulants are commonly used in COVID-19patients they are not associated with an increased incidence of UGIB.Conservative management is a common approach that results in similar outcomescompared to upper GI endoscopic treatment. Apparently, UGIB in COVID-19 seems nothave a detrimental effect and only one study showed an increased mortality inthose who developed UGIB during hospitalization. SUMMARY: Incidence of UGIB inCOVID-19 patients is similar to that of the general population. Despite thewidespread use of anticoagulants in these patients, they are not associated with an increased risk of UGIB. Conservative management could be an effective option, especially for patients that are at risk of intubation.

TI  - Diagnosis of COVID-19 associated arthritis in patients with or without underlyingrheumatic and musculoskeletal disease supported by musculoskeletal ultrasound: a case series from three European centres.
LID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/an1yrh [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic concerns the field of rheumatology in many ways. Arthritis in conjunction with COVID-19 is increasinglyreported. However, clinical data are still limited and there is lack of adetailed characterisation of COVID-19 associated arthritis by musculoskeletalultrasound (MSUS). This case series reports different forms of COVID-19associated arthritis supported by MSUS in patients with or without underlyingrheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD). METHODS: From March 2020 to July2021, adult patients (n=10) with arthritis timely related to COVID-19 wereassessed in three European centres by clinical and laboratory values andadditionally MSUS. RESULTS: In the group without underlying RMD (n=6), twopatients presented with polyarticular arthralgia during severe COVID-19, swellingwas rarely seen and MSUS demonstrated arthritis only in a few joints affected.The other four patients showed arthritis four to 16 weeks after mild or moderate COVID-19 (without hospitalisation): polyarthritis (n=1), oligoarthritis of theupper and lower limb (n=2), and in one case, late-onset rheumatoid arthritis(LORA) was newly diagnosed. In the group with an underlying RMD (n=4), anincrease of disease activity was reported by MSUS during mild and mild-moderateCOVID-19. In general, MSUS often presented power Doppler (PD) positive synovitis and tenosynovitis. CONCLUSIONS: In our patients without underlying RMD,arthritides associated with COVID-19 are comparable to the clinical picture of a reactive arthritis (ReA) or other virus-related arthritides (e.g. parvovirusB19). New onset or flares of RMD possibly triggered by COVID-19 are noteworthy.

TI  - Better together: the use of virus-induced gene silencing technique to repress theexpression of two endogenous citrus genes simultaneously.
PG  - 2106079
LID - 10.1080/15592324.2022.2106079 [doi]
AB  - Virus-induced gene silencing is a promising technique for functional genomicsstudies. Citrus tristeza virus was employed successfully to create an infectious clone that was used to silence endogenous citrus genes. Phytoene desaturase (PDS)and delta (delta)-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) were targetedsuccessfully in citrus. Silencing PDS usually results in a photo-bleached leafphenotype while silencing ALAD causes discrete yellow spots in leaves. Silencing two or more genes simultaneously using the same infectious clone could bedifficult due to the capacity of the plasmid and subsequent cloning. On the otherhand, inoculating a new construct into a citrus plant pre-infected with anotherconstruct fails due to the superinfection exclusion phenomenon. Herein, I report our successful trials whereby we simultaneously graft-inoculate constructstargeting PDS and ALAD. The budwoods were graft-inoculated into the same tree buton two different branches. Interestingly, a new phenotype was produced because ofthe silencing of the two genes, which we called "color-breaking". The phenotypewas observed in both branches. Gene expression analysis showed a significantreduction of PDS and ALAD transcripts. This finding suggests the possibility oftargeting more than one gene using different constructs, however, thegraft-inoculation must be at the same time.

TI  - A circular RNA vector for targeted plant gene silencing based on an asymptomatic viroid.
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15929 [doi]
AB  - Gene silencing for functional studies in plants has been largely facilitated bymanipulating viral genomes with inserts from host genes to trigger virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) against the corresponding mRNAs. However, viral genomesencode multiple proteins and can disrupt plant homeostasis by interfering withendogenous cell mechanisms. To try to circumvent this functional limitation, wehave developed a silencing method based on the minimal autonomously-infectiousnucleic acids currently known: viroids, which lack proven coding capability. The genome of Eggplant latent viroid, an asymptomatic viroid, was manipulated withinsertions ranging between 21 to 42 nucleotides. Our results show that, although larger insertions might be tolerated, the maintenance of the secondary structure appears to be critical for viroid genome stability. Remarkably, these modifiedELVd molecules are able to induce systemic infection promoting the silencing oftarget genes in eggplant. Inspired by the design of artificial microRNAs, we havedeveloped a simple and standardized procedure to generate stable insertions into the ELVd genome capable of silencing a specific target gene. Analogously to VIGS,we have termed our approach Viroid Induced Gene Silencing (VdIGS) and demonstratethat is a promising tool for dissecting gene functions in eggplant.

LID - 10.1107/S2059798322006349 [doi]
AB  - Modern small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments with neutrons (SANS) or X-rays(SAXS) combined with contrast variation provide comprehensive information aboutthe structure of large multicomponent macromolecules in solution and allow thesize, shape and relative arrangement of each component to be mapped out. Toobtain such information, it is essential to perform well designed experiments, inwhich all necessary steps, from assessing sample suitability to structuremodeling, are properly executed. This paper describes alpha-SAS, an integrativeapproach that is useful for effectively planning a biological contrast-variation SAS experiment. The accurate generation of expected experimental intensitiesusing alpha-SAS allows the substantial acceleratation of research into thestructure and function of biomacromolecules by minimizing the time and costsassociated with performing a SAS experiment. The method is validated using a few basic structures with known analytical expressions for scattering intensity andusing experimental SAXS data from Arabidopsis beta-amylase 1 protein and SANSdata from the histidine kinase-Sda complex and from human dystrophin without and with a membrane-mimicking nanodisk. Simulation of a SANS contrast-variationexperiment is performed for synthetic nanobodies that effectively neutralizeSARS-CoV-2.

TI  - When 3D genome technology meets viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28040 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian chromosomes undergo varying degrees of compression to formthree-dimensional genome structures. These three-dimensional structures undergodynamic and precise chromatin interactions to achieve precise spatial andtemporal regulation of gene expression. Most eukaryotic DNA viruses can invadetheir genomes into the nucleus. However, it is still poorly understood how theviral genome is precisely positioned after entering the host cell nucleus to findthe most suitable location and whether it can specifically interact with the hostgenome to hijack the host transcriptional factories or even integrate into thehost genome to complete its transcription and replication rapidly. Chromosomeconformation capture technology can reveal long-range chromatin interactionsbetween different chromosomal sites in the nucleus, potentially providing areference for viral DNA-host chromatin interactions. This review summarized theresearch progress on the three-dimensional interaction between virus and hostgenome and the impact of virus integration into the host genome on genetranscription regulation, aiming to provide new insights into chromatininteraction and viral gene transcription regulation, laying the foundation forthe treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  - Reconstruction and validation of entire virus model with complete genome frommixed resolution cryo-EM density.
LID - 10.1039/d2fd00053a [doi]
AB  - It is very difficult to reconstruct computationally a large biomolecular complex in its biological entirety from experimental data. The resulting atomistic model should not contain gaps structurally and it should yield stable dynamics. We, forthe first time, reconstruct from the published incomplete cryo-EM density acomplete MS2 virus at atomistic resolution, that is, the capsid with the genome, and validate the result by all-atom molecular dynamics with explicit water. Theavailable experimental data includes a high resolution protein capsid and aninhomogeneously resolved genome map. For the genomic RNA, apart from 16 hairpins with atomistic resolution, the strands near the capsid's inner surface wereresolved up to the nucleic backbone level, and the innermost density wascompletely unresolved. As a result, only 242 nucleotides (out of 3569) werepositioned, while only a fragmented backbone was outlined for the rest of thegenome, making a detailed model reconstruction necessary. For modelreconstruction, in addition to the available atomistic structure information, we extensively used the predicted secondary structure of the genome (base pairing). The technique was based on semi-automatic building of relatively large strands ofRNA with subsequent manual positioning over the traced backbone. The entire virusstructure (capsid + genome) was validated by a molecular dynamics run inphysiological solution with ions at standard conditions confirming the stability of the model.

AB  - Norovirus (NoV) belongs to the Calciviridae family that causes diarrhoea,vomiting, and stomach pain in people who have acute gastroenteritis (AGE).Identifying multi-epitope dependent vaccines for single stranded positive senseviruses such as NoV has been a long due. Although efforts have been in place tolook into the candidate epitopes, understanding molecular mimicry and finding newepitopes for inducing immune responses against the T/B-cells which play animportant role for the cell-mediated and humoral immunity was not dealt with ingreat detail. The current study focuses on identifying new epitopes from various databases that were filtered for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Theadjuvant beta-defensin along with different linkers were used for vaccineconstruction. Further, the binding relationship between the vaccine construct andtoll-like immune receptor (TLR3) complex was determined using a molecular dockinganalysis, followed by molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns. The vaccinecandidate developed expresses good solubility with a score of 0.530, Z-score of-4.39 and molecular docking score of -140.4 +/- 12.1. The MD trajectories reveal that there is a stability between TLR3 and the developed vaccine candidate withan average of 0.91 nm RMSD value and also the system highest occupancy H-bondformed between GLU127 of TLR3 and TYR10 of vaccine candidate (61.55%). Four more H-bonds exist with an occupancy of more than 32% between TLR3 and the vaccinecandidates which makes it stable. Thus, the multi-epitope based vaccine developedin the present study forms the basis for further experimental investigations todevelop a potentially good vaccine against NoV.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.Sarma.

AB  - Cough is a frequent reason for consultation in the general practitioner's office.Most of the time, the symptom is harmless and self-limiting, as in the case of a banal cold cough, for example - however, serious diseases such as malignanciescan also be the cause. Evaluation is therefore not always easy. This articlepresents a targeted and appropriate approach and discusses which treatments arerecommended and effective.Acute and chronic cough are differentiated according tothe duration of symptoms (up to 8 weeks/longer than 8 weeks). The most commoncause of acute cough is a self-limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract; the most important differential diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia.If there are no defined warning signs (red flags), the history and clinicalexamination are sufficient to establish the diagnosis in the case of an acutecough; medication is not necessary. In the case of a chronic cough, a chest X-rayis usually ordered and then further investigations are carried out in accordance with the most probable suspected diagnosis; probationary therapies are animportant part of the workup. Coughs that are refractory to treatment orunexplained require individualised treatment (pharmacological, includingoff-label, non-pharmacological) and regular re-evaluation.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (COVID-19) and itsdiverse courses of disease from mild to critical illness frequently is not onlyan acute disease, but will - in a proportion of those affected - lead to organstructure and body function deficits that still exist or become apparent afterthe acute stage of disease. When clinically relevant symptoms or functionaldeficits (impairments) are documented more than four weeks after COVID-19 onset, the syndrome is called "Long-COVID", from 12 weeks after onset onwards"Post-COVID".In such cases and when everyday life functioning or return to workare affected by persisting deficits specialized rehabilitation treatment isindicated. An individual medical, frequently multi-professional diagnosticevaluation is mandatory in that situation: For adequate treatment, it isimportant to identify and objectify the individually underlying health conditionsbased on knowledge about the diverse potential consequences of COVID-19, toassess type and severity of functional consequences (impairments, activitylimitations, and restrictions of participation) of Long-/Post-COVID individually,and then to decide on the treatment necessities and plans. With regard torehabilitation, need and decision for either pulmonary, neurological, cardiac, orpsychosomatic rehabilitation depends on the individual medical presentation.

LID - 10.1002/hed.27083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parotid lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) is a rare malignant tumor.The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological features of parotid LEC. METHODS: All patients clinicopathological information diagnosedparotid LEC from 2005 to 2017 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 146 cases ofparotid LECs were identified. Of these, 126 (86.3%) were primary and 20 (13.7%)were secondary LECs. Patients with secondary LEC tended to have tumors withearlier TNM staging than those with primary (p = 0.031). The tumor cells in 87(94.6%, 87/92) cases tested positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Cervical node metastases were present at diagnosis in 46 (31.5%) cases. Overall survival at 5and 10 years was 97.0% and 90.8%, respectively. Older age was an adverseprognostic indicator for overall survival (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Parotid LECis associated with EBV and an increased rate of cervical node metastases.However, most patients, especially younger ones, have a good prognosis.

XBP1 expression was significantly elevated in both CRSsNP patients and mice whowere accompanied with mucosal thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia and chemosis,glandular hyperplasia, and dense infiltration of inflammatory cells. Silencing ofXBP1 suppressed the development of CRSsNP in mice. Mechanistically, knockdown of XBP1 downregulated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a),and overexpression of XBP1 led to the opposite result. Silencing of HIF-1ainhibited beta-catenin expression and impaired the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.Further overexpression of HIF-1a in XBP1-silenced CRSsNP mice exacerbatedpathological changes in mouse nasal mucosal tissues, promoted inflammation, andactivated the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Taken together, overexpression of XBP1may be associated with increased expression of HIF-1a and possibly contribute to the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation and the development of CRSsNP.

TI  - Investigation of COVID-19 Misinformation in Arabic on Twitter: Content Analysis.
PG  - e37007
LID - 10.2196/37007 [doi]
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been occurring concurrently with aninfodemic of misinformation about the virus. Spreading primarily on social media,there has been a significant academic effort to understand the English side ofthis infodemic. However, much less attention has been paid to the Arabic side.Objective: There is an urgent need to examine the scale of Arabic COVID-19disinformation. This study empirically examines how Arabic speakers use specific hashtags on Twitter to express antivaccine and antipandemic views to uncovertrends in their social media usage. By exploring this topic, we aim to fill a gapin the literature that can help understand conspiracies in Arabic aroundCOVID-19. Methods: This study used content analysis to understand how 13 popular Arabic hashtags were used in antivaccine communities. We used Twitter AcademicAPI v2 to search for the hashtags from the beginning of August 1, 2006, untilOctober 10, 2021. After downloading a large data set from Twitter, we identified major categories or topics in the sample data set using emergent coding. Emergentcoding was chosen because of its ability to inductively identify the themes that repeatedly emerged from the data set. Then, after revising the coding scheme, we coded the rest of the tweets and examined the results. In the second attempt and with a modified codebook, an acceptable intercoder agreement was reached(Krippendorff alpha>/=.774). Results: In total, we found 476,048 tweets, mostlyposted in 2021. First, the topic of infringing on civil liberties (n=483, 41.1%) covers ways that governments have allegedly infringed on civil liberties duringthe pandemic and unfair restrictions that have been imposed on unvaccinatedindividuals. Users here focus on topics concerning their civil liberties andfreedoms, claiming that governments violated such rights following the pandemic. Notably, users denounce government efforts to force them to take any of theCOVID-19 vaccines for different reasons. This was followed by vaccine-relatedconspiracies (n=476, 40.5%), including a Deep State dictating pandemic policies, mistrusting vaccine efficacy, and discussing unproven treatments. Although users tweeted about a range of different conspiracy theories, mistrusting the vaccine'sefficacy, false or exaggerated claims about vaccine risks and vaccine-relateddiseases, and governments and pharmaceutical companies profiting from vaccinesand intentionally risking the general public health appeared the most. Finally,calls for action (n=149, 12.6%) encourage individuals to participate in civildemonstrations. These calls range from protesting to encouraging other users totake action about the vaccine mandate. For each of these categories, we alsoattempted to trace the logic behind the different categories by exploringdifferent types of conspiracy theories for each category. Conclusions: Based onour findings, we were able to identify 3 prominent topics that were prevalentamongst Arabic speakers on Twitter. These categories focused on violations ofcivil liberties by governments, conspiracy theories about the vaccines, and callsfor action. Our findings also highlight the need for more research to betterunderstand the impact of COVID-19 disinformation on the Arab world.

LID - 10.1007/s11042-022-13368-z [doi]
AB  - Research aimed at finding solutions to the problem of the diffusion of distinctforms of non-genuine information online across multiple domains has attractedgrowing interest in recent years, from opinion spam to fake news detection.Currently, partly due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak and the subsequentproliferation of unfounded claims and highly biased content, attention hasfocused on developing solutions that can automatically assess the genuineness of health information. Most of these approaches, applied both to Web pages andsocial media content, rely primarily on the use of handcrafted features inconjunction with Machine Learning. In this article, instead, we propose a health misinformation detection model that exploits as features the embeddedrepresentations of some structural and content characteristics of Web pages,which are obtained using an embedding model pre-trained on medical data. Suchfeatures are employed within a deep learning classification model, whichcategorizes genuine health information versus health misinformation. The purpose of this article is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model,namely Vec4Cred, with respect to the problem considered. This model represents anevolution of a previous one, with respect to which new features and architecturalchoices have been considered and illustrated in this work.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Networks for Detecting Anomalies in Chest X-Rays.
PG  - 7833516
LID - 10.1155/2022/7833516 [doi]
AB  - X-ray images aid medical professionals in the diagnosis and detection ofpathologies. They are critical, for example, in the diagnosis of pneumonia, thedetection of masses, and, more recently, the detection of COVID-19-relatedconditions. The chest X-ray is one of the first imaging tests performed whenpathology is suspected because it is one of the most accessible radiologicalexaminations. Deep learning-based neural networks, particularly convolutionalneural networks, have exploded in popularity in recent years and have becomeindispensable tools for image classification. Transfer learning approaches, inparticular, have enabled the use of previously trained networks' knowledge,eliminating the need for large data sets and lowering the high computationalcosts associated with this type of network. This research focuses on using deeplearning-based neural networks to detect anomalies in chest X-rays. Differentconvolutional network-based approaches are investigated using the ChestX-ray14database, which contains over 100,000 X-ray images with labels relating to 14different pathologies, and different classification objectives are evaluated.Starting with the pretrained networks VGG19, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3, networks based on transfer learning are implemented, with different schemes for theclassification stage and data augmentation. Similarly, an ad hoc architecture is proposed and evaluated without transfer learning for the classification objectivewith more examples. The results show that transfer learning produces acceptableresults in most of the tested cases, indicating that it is a viable first stepfor using deep networks when there are not enough labeled images, which is acommon problem when working with medical images. The ad hoc network, on the otherhand, demonstrated good generalization with data augmentation and an acceptableaccuracy value. The findings suggest that using convolutional neural networkswith and without transfer learning to design classifiers for detectingpathologies in chest X-rays is a good idea.

AB  - Scientists and regular citizens alike search for ways to manage the widespreadeffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While scientists are busy in their labs, other citizens often turn to online sources to report their experiences and concernsand to seek and share knowledge of the virus. The text generated by those usersin online social media platforms can provide valuable insights about evolvingusers' opinions and attitudes. The objective of this research is to analyze text of such user disclosures to study human communication during a pandemic in fourprimary ways. First, we analyze Twitter tweet information, generated throughoutthe pandemic, to understand users' communications concerning COVID-19 and howthose communications have evolved during the pandemic. Second, we analyzelinguistic sentiment concepts (analytic, authentic, clout, and tone concepts) in different Twitter settings (sentiment in tweets with pictures or no pictures and tweets versus retweets). Third, we investigate the relationship between Twittertweets with additional forms of internet activity, namely, Google searches andWikipedia page views. Finally, we create and use a dictionary of specificCOVID-19-related concepts (e.g., symptom of lost taste) to assess how the use of those concepts in tweets are related to the spread of information and theresulting influence of Twitter users. The analysis showed a surprisingly lack of emotion in the initial phases of the pandemic as people were information seeking.As time progressed, there were more expressions of sentiment, including anger.Further, tweets with and without pictures and/or video had statisticallysignificant differences in text sentiment characteristics. Similarly, there were differences between the sentiment in tweets and retweets and tweets. We alsofound that Google and Wikipedia searches were predictive of sentiment in thetweets. Finally, a variable representing a dictionary of COVID-related conceptswas statistically significant when related to users' Twitter influence score and number of retweets, illustrating the general impact of COVID-19 on Twitter andhuman communication. Overall, the results provide insights into humancommunication as well as models of human internet and social media use. Thesefindings could be useful for the management of global challenges beyond, ordifferent from, a pandemic.

AB  - Objective: The novel coronavirus nucleic acid results are the core indicators of illness monitoring. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship betweenimmunological features and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by analyzing theclinical and immunological features in nonsevere COVID-19 cases. Methods: Datafrom nonsevere COVID-19 patients admitted to Haihe Hospital from May 2020 to June2021 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: (1) A total of 122cases were reviewed in the present study, including 38 mild and 84 moderatecases. The average age of mild cases was significantly different from moderatecases (P < 0.001). Eight patients complained of hyposmia and it was more frequentin mild cases (P < 0.001). The nucleic acid positive duration (NPD) of nonsevere novel coronavirus was 20.49 (confidence interval (CI) 17.50-3.49) days. (2) Thelevels of specific IgM and IgG for COVID-19 were higher in mild cases than inmoderate cases (P=0.023 and P=0.047, respectively). (3) The correlation analysis with antibodies and T-cell subtypes showed that the lymphocyte (LYM) count, Tcells, CD4(+)T cells, and CD8(+)T cells had a linear correlation with NPD. (4)Among the 93 patients monitored, 62 COVID-19 cases presented a progressive riseof specific IgM and IgG. The daily increase rates of IgM and IgG were 38.42% (CI 28.22-48.61%) and 24.90% (CI 0.23-29.58%), respectively. Conclusion: The levelsand daily increase rates of specific IgM and IgG against the virus can varybetween cases. The NPD presented a linear correlation with the LYM, T cells,CD4(+)T cells, and CD8+T cells. Hence, more attention should be paid to theseindicators in clinical practice.

AB  - Co-infection of RNA viruses may contribute to their recombination and causesevere clinical symptoms. However, the tracking and identification of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection persist as challenges. Due to the lack of methods for detectingco-infected samples in a large amount of deep sequencing data, the lineagecomposition, spatial-temporal distribution, and frequency of SARS-CoV-2co-infection events in the population remains unclear. Here, we propose ahypergeometric distribution-based method named Cov2Coinfect with the ability todecode the lineage composition from 50,809 deep sequencing data. By resolving themutational patterns in each sample, Cov2Coinfect can precisely determine theco-infected SARS-CoV-2 variants from deep sequencing data. Results from twoindependent and parallel projects in the United States achieved a similarco-infection rate of 0.3% approximately 0.5% in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.Notably, all co-infected variants were highly consistent with the co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the regional epidemiology, demonstrating that theco-circulation of different variants is an essential prerequisite forco-infection. Overall, our study not only provides a robust method to identifythe co-infected SARS-CoV-2 variants from sequencing samples, but also highlights the urgent need to pay more attention to co-infected patients for better disease prevention and control.

AB  - This research estimated the optimal size and composition of the portfolio, andits benefit-cost ratio, of COVID-19 vaccines that Colombia should negotiate as a price-taking country. The Advance Market Commitments (AMC) mathematical model wasapplied using the parameters from the Colombian context and from a literaturereview. The findings indicate that the optimal portfolio of Colombia shouldinclude 13 vaccines, mainly from two platforms: i) RNA and ii) inactivated virus.The benefit-cost ratio was always greater than one in the baseline scenario andafter performing many sensitivity analyses on parameters such as the percentageof the population at risk, the price per treatment, and the herd immunitythreshold, among others. In a context of high uncertainty, the best decision -with high benefit - is to anticipate the negotiation processes with the providersof COVID-19 vaccines, which will generate positive economic and health impacts.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is theetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 340 million people since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019, resulting inapproximately 55 million deaths. The rapid and effective diagnosis of COVID-19patients is vital to prevent the spread of the disease. In a previous study, wereported a novel temperature-responsive liposome-linked immunosorbent assay(TLip-LISA) using biotinylated-TLip that exhibited high detection sensitivity forthe prostate-specific antigen. Herein, we used immunoglobulin-TLip (IgG-TLip), inwhich the antibodies were directly conjugated to the liposomal surface tosimplify pretreatment procedures and reduce the detection time for SARS-CoV-2.The results indicated that TLip-LISA could detect the recombinant nucleocapsidprotein and the nucleocapsid protein in inactivated virus with 20 min incubation time in total, and the limit of detection was calculated to be 2.2 and 1.0 pg/mL,respectively. Therefore, TLip-LISA has high potential to be used in clinic forrapid diagnosis and disease control.

TI  - EXPLAINABLE FEATURES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGH OR LOW SPREAD OF SARS-COV-2: AFRICAIN VIEW.
PG  - e01301
LID - 10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01301 [doi]
AB  - The low spread of the global pandemic in Africa has raised concerns.Consequently, many commentators have misconstrued concerns suspecting weather,and immunity to be prime reasons. This study investigates the factors associated with the high & low spread of the SARS-CoV-2 (also known as COVID-19) and employsgraphical Bayesian models to investigate feature interactions and causality.Through experimentation with the Bayesian framework, we propose that: (i) theproportion of people within the country population who test positive forSARS-CoV-2 and a country's test capacity cause the rate of spread of the virus[i.e., P(S|P) & P(S|T)] (ii) poverty gaps, welfare and freedom of the pressdirectly cause the spread of the virus [i.e., P(S|E), P(S|W), & P(S|R)] (iii)Government effectiveness serves as a parent to poverty gaps and welfare [ i.e.,P(E|G) & P(W|G)] and voice and accountability serve as a parent to freedom of thepress [i.e., P(R|V)]. For the output, we "dichotomized" regions based on the"share of global infection rate" metric (SGIR) that implicitly accounts for agiven region's population, and we find that - out of two hundred and nineteencountries investigated, one hundred and twenty-seven have SGIR >/= 1%, and themajority (44 out 58 - 75.86%) of Africa countries (as at 12th February 2021) haveSGIR < 1%. With Africa in the mirror, the study shows that only 2.2% of theAfrica population has been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and finds that the lowproportion of population tested [i.e., P(S|P)] for SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of thelow spread (i.e., cases reported) of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa. Similarly, thefragmented socioeconomic statuses [i.e., P(S|E)] among citizens leads tosocioeconomic distancing, causing socio-class gaps between the rich andpoor/average citizens, ensuring low interaction in social space, thus limitingthe spread.

AB  - We conducted a systematic literature review on the ethical considerations of the use of contact tracing app technology, which was extensively implemented duringthe COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid and extensive use of this technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, while benefiting the public well-being by providinginformation about people's mobility and movements to control the spread of thevirus, raised several ethical concerns for the post-COVID-19 era. To investigate these concerns for the post-pandemic situation and provide direction for futureevents, we analyzed the current ethical frameworks, research, and case studiesabout the ethical usage of tracing app technology. The results suggest there are seven essential ethical considerations-privacy, security, acceptability,government surveillance, transparency, justice, and voluntariness-in the ethical use of contact tracing technology. In this paper, we explain and discuss theseconsiderations and how they are needed for the ethical usage of this technology. The findings also highlight the importance of developing integrated guidelinesand frameworks for implementation of such technology in the post- COVID-19 world.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary materialavailable at 10.1007/s10676-022-09659-6.

AB  - The risk of developing COVID-19 and its variants may be higher in those withpre-existing health conditions such as thyroid disease, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), breast tissue disease, chronic dermatitis, and other severe infections. Early andprecise identification of these disorders is critical. A huge number of patients in nations like India require early and rapid testing as a preventative measure. The problem of imbalance arises from the skewed nature of data in which theinstances from majority class are classified correct, while the minority class isunfortunately misclassified by many classifiers. When it comes to human life,this kind of misclassification is unacceptable. To solve the misclassificationissue and improve accuracy in such datasets, we applied a variety of databalancing techniques to several machine learning algorithms. The outcomes areencouraging, with a considerable increase in accuracy. As an outcome of theseproper diagnoses, we can make plans and take the required actions to stoppatients from acquiring serious health issues or viral infections.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is a subtype of gastriccancer morphologically characterized by massive lymphocyte infiltration. Weherein report the short-term outcomes of three rare cases of intramucosal EBVaGC treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Histologically, the lesions exhibited poorly to moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma withoutlymphovascular invasion, and in situ hybridization revealed EBV-encoded smallRNA. Helicobacter pylori infection was not found in any of the lesions. Duringthe 3 to 12 months of follow-up following ESD, none of the ESD-treated patientsshowed evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases. Essentialcharacteristics of intramucosal EBVaGC may include lymphocyte infiltration intothe mucosal stroma or cancer nests as well as the presence of a lace pattern. We believe that ESD might be a safe and suitable treatment method for intramucosalEBVaGC that avoids needless surgery, particularly in patients with severecomorbidities or a high operational risk.

AB  - The gut microbiome is intricately coupled with immune regulation and metabolism, but its role in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood.Severe and fatal COVID-19 is characterized by poor anti-viral immunity andhypercoagulation, particularly in males. Here, we define multiple pathways bywhich the gut microbiome protects mammalian hosts from SARS-CoV-2 intranasalinfection, both locally and systemically, via production of short-chain fattyacids (SCFAs). SCFAs reduced viral burdens in the airways and intestines bydownregulating the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), and enhancing adaptive immunity via GPR41 and 43 in male animals. Wefurther identify a novel role for the gut microbiome in regulating systemiccoagulation response by limiting megakaryocyte proliferation and plateletturnover via the Sh2b3-Mpl axis. Taken together, our findings have unravelednovel functions of SCFAs and fiber-fermenting gut bacteria to dampen viral entry and hypercoagulation and promote adaptive antiviral immunity.

AB  - Background and Aims: Aerosol protection equipment aim at protecting theanaesthesiologist, from aerosol-borne infections, namely, severe acuterespiratory syndrome corona virus-2. Methods: We improvised the first-generation intubation box (IB) by increasing its dimensions, including heat and moistureexchanger with filter, suction catheter, and attaching arm sleeves to make amodified intubation box (MIB). The impact of IB, MIB and transparent sheets (TS) on the patient outcomes during airway management was evaluated. Results: Asignificant difference in median (interquartile range in minutes) was observed intime to intubate between IB (4 [4-5]); TS (0.5 [0.3-0.5]) and MIB (0.3[0.3-1.5]): P = 0.004); and airway devices; McCoy (0.5 [0.3-2]), CMac (0.5[0.3-1.5]): P = 0.004. First-pass success was 100% with the TS, whereas more thanthree attempts were required with IB 66.7% and 5.2% with MIB. Video laryngoscope was associated with less airway-related adverse events (ARAEs). The need for maskventilation (and hence possible aerosolisation) was maximum with IB. All theARAEs resolved uneventfully. No breach of personal protective equipment wasobserved; none of the health-care professionals involved in patient caredeveloped any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Conclusion: Video laryngoscope is favourable for managing airway in COVID-19 times. In view of the ongoing pandemicand added protection that it offers, it is worthwhile to include the MIB in thearmamentarium for managing the airway of patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Mixed-methods process evaluation of a residence-based SARS-CoV-2 testingparticipation pilot on a UK university campus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 1470

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is an important strategy for controlling virus outbreaks onuniversity campuses during the COVID-19 pandemic but testing participation rates can be low. The Residence-Based Testing Participation Pilot (RB-TPP) was a novel intervention implemented at two student residences on a large UK universitycampus over 4 weeks. The aim of the pilot was to increase the frequency ofasymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 saliva testing onsite. This process evaluation aimed todetermine whether RB-TPP was implemented as planned and identify implementationbarriers and facilitators. METHODS: A mixed-methods process evaluation wasconducted alongside the RB-TPP. Evaluation participants were students (opting in,or out of RB-TPP) and staff with a role in service provision or student support. Monitoring data were collected from the intervention delivery team and meetingrecords. Data were collected from students via online survey (n = 152) and seven focus groups (n = 30), and from staff via individual interviews (n = 13).Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and qualitative data thematically. Barriers and facilitators to implementation were mapped to the 'Capability,Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour' (COM-B) behaviour change framework. RESULTS:Four hundred sixty-four students opted to participate in RB-TPP (98% of students living onsite). RB-TPP was implemented broadly as planned but relaxed socialdistancing was terminated early due to concerns relating to national escalationof the COVID-19 Delta variant, albeit testing continued. Most students (97.9%)perceived the period of relaxed social distancing within residences positively.The majority engaged in asymptomatic testing (88%); 46% (52% of testers) werefully compliant with pre-determined testing frequency. Implementation wasfacilitated by convenience and efficiency of testing, and reduction in thenegative impacts of isolation through opportunities for students to socialise.Main barriers to implementation were perceived mixed-messages about the rules,ambivalent attitudes, and lack of adherence to COVID-19 protective measures inthe minority. CONCLUSIONS: This process evaluation identifies factors that helpor hinder the success of university residence-based outbreak prevention andmanagement strategies. RB-TPP led to increased rates of SARS-CoV-2 testingparticipation among students in university residences. Perceived normalisation ofuniversity life significantly enhanced student mental wellbeing. The complexityand challenge generated by multiple lines of communication and rapid adaptions toa changing pandemic context was evident. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UKAS307727-02-01; Pre-results.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dental education: digitalization - progressor regress? Example of an online hands-on course.
PG  - 591
LID - 10.1186/s12909-022-03638-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the accompanying contactrestrictions, a new challenge arose for dental education. Despite the limitedoverall situation, it must be ensured that, in addition to theoretical content,practical skills in particular continue to be taught. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and implement an online hands-on course for dental students that ensures practical training, even during the pandemic. METHODS: The newlydeveloped course was held from April 2020 to March 2021. A total of six groups(each consisting of approximately 40-50 students) took part in the course. Theparticipating students were in their 3rd, 4th or 5th year of study. The coursetaught theoretical basics (via an online platform) and promoted the learning ofpractical/surgical techniques on models such as bananas, pork bellies, or chickenthighs with live demonstrations (via ZOOM) and interactive post-preparation bystudents at home (and in a rotating small group of 3-7 students on site). Studentself-evaluation (at the beginning and end of the course) and course evaluationwere performed using questionnaires. The learning success was analyzed (throughself-evaluations) using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (significance level alpha =0.05). RESULTS: Concerning students self-evaluations, the theoretical knowledge, general surgical skills (such as surgical instrument handling), and specificsurgical skills (such as performing a kite flap) improved during the course, withsignificant results (p < 0.001 for each). About 60% of the students rated thecourse overall as excellent (grades 9 or 10 on a Likert scale of 1 to 10). Thetechnical implementation of the course was rated with a median of 9 (= very good,on a Likert scale of 1 to 10). 38.5% described the applicability of the skillslearned for their later professional life as extremely good. CONCLUSIONS: Theresults of this work suggest that, within the limitations of this study, theintroduced concept of an online hands-on course could be an appropriate form ofteaching practical dental skills, even during a pandemic. Further research isneeded in the field of digital education for dental students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is one of the most common clinicalmanifestations of vulva. Thirteen percent of women have symptomatic vulvardiseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression profile ofcircular RNA (circRNAs) in vulvar lichen sclerosus, and to identify theunderlying core genes of VLS. METHODS: We removed rRNA for sequencing, andscreened the differentially expressed messenger RNA (mRNAs), long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) and single-stranded circRNA in 20 groups of VLS tissues and 20 groupsof healthy female vulvar skin tissues. Bioinformatics analysis was used toanalyze its potential functions. RESULTS: A total of 2545 differentiallyexpressed mRNAs were assessed in VLS patients, of which 1541 samples wereup-regulated and 1004 samples were down-regulated. A total of 1453 differentiallyexpressed lncRNAs were assessed, of which 812 samples were up-regulated and 641samples were down-regulated. A total of 79 differentially expressed circRNAs wereassessed, of which 54 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated. Thedifferential expression of circRNAs was closely related to biological processesand molecular functions. The differences in circRNAs were mainly related to the"human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection" signaling pathway and the "axonguidance" signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The profile of abnormal regulation ofcircRNA exists in VLS. According to biological informatics analysis, thedysregulation of circRNAs may be related to the pathogenesis and pathologicalprocess of VLS.

TI  - Spatial-temporal-demographic and virological changes of hand, foot and mouthdisease incidence after vaccination in a vulnerable region of China.
PG  - 1468
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13860-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) vaccine has been used in Hefei forseveral years, and the epidemiological significance of vaccination in this areais unclear. We aims to explore the spatial-temporal-demographic and virologicalchanges of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) after vaccination in China.METHODS: The data for HFMD from 2012 to 2020 were downloaded with the help ofHFMD reporting system of Hefei Center for Disease Control and Prevention andcombined with the EV-A71 vaccination status in Hefei. The study defined theperiod between 2012 to 2016 as the pre-vaccination period and explored the effectof vaccination on the incidence of HFMD by comparing the changes of HFMD beforeand after vaccination in terms of spatial, temporal, demographic and virological aspects. RESULTS: During the study period, a higher incidence occurred in urbanarea and the random distribution changed to a slight cluster after vaccination.HFMD incidence had inconsistent seasonality over years, with one or two incidencepeaks in varying years. The morbidity decreased from 215.22/105 in 2012-2016 to179.81/105 in 2017-2020 (p < 0.001). Boys, 0-4 years old children and Scatteredchildren were more susceptible to HFMD compared with the others, the proportions decreased after vaccination except in Scattered children. The main pathogenicenterovirus gradually changed from EV-A71 to Other Enteroviruses, especiallycoxsackieviruses A6 (CV-A6) after the implementation of EV-A71 vaccination.CONCLUSIONS: The EV-A71 vaccine was effective in reducing the incidence of HFMDand changing the spatial, temporal, demographic, and virological characteristic. These changes should be considered during the vaccination implementation tofurther reduce the disease burden of HFMD.

TI  - Long COVID headache.
PG  - 93
LID - 10.1186/s10194-022-01450-8 [doi]
AB  - Headache is among the most frequent symptoms persisting or newly developing aftercoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as part of the so-called long COVID syndrome.The knowledge on long COVID headache is still limited, however growing evidenceis defining the features of this novel condition, in particular regardingclinical characteristics, some pathophysiological mechanisms and first treatment recommendations. Long COVID headache can present in the form of worsening of apreexisting primary headache, or, more specifically, in the form of a new(intermittent or daily) headache starting during the acute infection or after adelay. It often presents together with other long COVID symptoms, most frequentlywith hyposmia. It can manifest with a migrainous or, more frequently, with atension-type-like phenotype. Persistent activation of the immune system andtrigeminovascular activation are thought to play a role. As there are virtuallyno treatment studies, treatment currently is largely guided by the existingguidelines for primary headaches with the corresponding phenotype. The presentreport, a collaborative work of the international group of the Junior EditorialBoard of The Journal of Headache and Pain aims to summarize the most recentevidence about long COVID headache and suggests approaches to the diagnosis andtreatment of this disorder.

TI  - Modelling of a triage scoring tool for SARS-COV-2 PCR testing in health-careworkers: data from the first German COVID-19 Testing Unit in Munich.
PG  - 664
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07627-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous scoring tools have been developed for assessing theprobability of SARS-COV-2 test positivity, though few being suitable or adaptedfor outpatient triage of health care workers. METHODS: We retrospectivelyanalysed 3069 patient records of health care workers admitted to the COVID-19Testing Unit of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat of Munich between January 27and September 30, 2020, for real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of naso-or oropharyngeal swabs. Variables for a multivariable logistic regression modelwere collected from self-completed case report forms and selected throughstepwise backward selection. Internal validation was conducted by bootstrapping. We then created a weighted point-scoring system from logistic regressioncoefficients. RESULTS: 4076 (97.12%) negative and 121 (2.88%) positive testresults were analysed. The majority were young (mean age: 38.0), female (69.8%)and asymptomatic (67.8%). Characteristics that correlated with PCR-positivityincluded close-contact professions (physicians, nurses, physiotherapists),flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, rhinorrhoea, headache), abdominal symptoms(nausea/emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhoea), less days since symptom onset, andcontact to a SARS-COV-2 positive index-case. Variables selected for the finalmodel included symptoms (fever, cough, abdominal pain, anosmia/ageusia) andexposures (to SARS-COV-positive individuals and, specifically, to positivepatients). Internal validation by bootstrapping yielded a corrected Area Underthe Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve of 76.43%. We present sensitivityand specificity at different prediction cut-off points. In a subgroup withfurther workup, asthma seems to have a protective effect with regard to testingresult positivity and measured temperature was found to be less predictive thananamnestic fever. CONCLUSIONS: We consider low threshold testing for health care workers a valuable strategy for infection control and are able to provide aneasily applicable triage score for the assessment of the probability of infectionin health care workers in case of resource scarcity.

TI  - Hypercompact adenine base editors based on transposase B guided by engineeredRNA.
LID - 10.1038/s41589-022-01077-5 [doi]
AB  - Transposon-associated transposase B (TnpB) is deemed an ancestral protein fortype V, Cas12 family members, and the closest ancestor to UnCas12f1. Previously, we reported a set of engineered guide RNAs supporting high indel efficiency forCas12f1 in human cells. Here we suggest a new technology whereby the engineeredguide RNAs also manifest high-efficiency programmable endonuclease activity forTnpB. We have termed this technology TaRGET (TnpB-augment RNA-based GenomeEditing Technology). Having this feature in mind, we established TnpB-basedadenine base editors (ABEs). A Tad-Tad mutant (V106W, D108Q) dimer fused to the Cterminus of dTnpB (D354A) showed the highest levels of A-to-G conversion. Thelimited targetable sites for TaRGET-ABE were expanded with engineered variants ofTnpB or optimized deaminases. Delivery of TaRGET-ABE also ensured potent A-to-Gconversion rates in mammalian genomes. Collectively, the TaRGET-ABE willcontribute to improving precise genome-editing tools that can be delivered byadeno-associated viruses, thereby harnessing the development of clusteredregularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based gene therapy.

LID - 10.1038/s41433-022-02169-1 [doi]
AB  - The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) system is an adaptive immune defencesystem that has gradually evolved in bacteria and archaea to combat invadingviruses and exogenous DNA. Advances in technology have enabled researchers toenhance their understanding of the immune process in vivo and its potential foruse in genome editing. Thus far, applications of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editingtechnology in ophthalmology have included gene therapy for corneal dystrophy,glaucoma, congenital cataract, Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinitispigmentosa, Usher syndrome, fundus neovascular disease, proliferativevitreoretinopathy, retinoblastoma and other eye diseases. Additionally, thecombination of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology with adeno-associated virus vector and inducible pluripotent stem cells provides further therapeutic avenues for the treatment of eye diseases. Nonetheless, many challenges remain in thedevelopment of clinically feasible retinal genome editing therapy. This reviewdiscusses the development, as well as mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 and itsapplications and challenges in gene therapy for eye diseases.

AB  - HIV-infected individuals could be at a greater risk for developing lung cancerthan the general population due to the higher prevalence in the former of humanpapillomavirus (HPV) in the oral cavity and higher smoking rates. Our aim was to assess HPV prevalence and E6 viral oncogene transcription in lung cancer samples from HIV-infected individuals. This was a single-center, retrospective study of acohort of HIV-1-infected patients diagnosed with and treated for lung cancer.Pathological lung samples archived as smears or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were subjected to HPV genotyping, detection of human p16 protein andassessment for HPV E6 mRNA expression. Lung cancer samples from 41 patients were studied, including squamous cell carcinoma (32%), adenocarcinoma (34%), non-smallcell cancer (27%), and small cell cancer (7%). HPV DNA was detected in 23 out of 41 (56%, 95% CI 41-70%) of samples and high-risk (HR)-HPV types were detected in 16 out of 41 (39%, 95% CI 26-54%), HPV-16 being the most prevalent [13/16 (81.3%,95% CI 57.0-93%]. In samples with sufficient material left: expression of p16 wasdetected in 3 out of 10 (30%) of HR-HPV DNA-positive tumors and in 3 out of 7(43%) of the negative ones; and E6 mRNA was detected in 2 out of 10 (20%) ofHPV-16-positive samples (squamous lung cancers). These two patients had abackground of a previous HPV-related neoplasia and smoking. HR-HPV DNA detection was prevalent in lung cancers in HIV-infected patients. However, viral oncogeneexpression was limited to patients with previous HPV-related cancers.

PG  - 13207
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17514-3 [doi]
AB  - Sputnik-V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is a heterologous, recombinant adenoviral (rAdv)vector-based, COVID-19 vaccine now used in > 70 countries. Yet there is ashortage of data on this vaccine's performance in diverse populations. Here, weperformed a prospective cohort study to assess the reactogenicity and immunologicoutcomes of Sputnik-V vaccination in Kazakhstan. COVID-19-free participants (n = 82 at baseline) were followed at day 21 after Sputnik-V dose 1 (rAd5) and dose 2 (rAd26). Self-reported local and systemic adverse events were captured usingquestionnaires. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to performSARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and immunologic assays. We observed that most of thereported adverse events were mild-to-moderate injection site or systemicreactions, no severe or potentially life-threatening conditions were reported,and dose 1 appeared to be more reactogenic than dose 2. The seroconversion ratewas 97% post-dose 1, remaining the same post-dose 2. The proportion ofparticipants with detectable virus neutralization was 83% post-dose 1, increasingto 98% post-dose 2, with the largest relative increase observed in participantswithout prior COVID-19 exposure. Dose 1 boosted nasal S-IgG and S-IgA, while the boosting effect of dose 2 on mucosal S-IgG, but not S-IgA, was only observed insubjects without prior COVID-19. Systemically, vaccination reduced serum levelsof growth regulated oncogene (GRO), which correlated with an elevation in bloodplatelet count. Overall, Sputnik-V dose 1 elicited both blood and mucosalSARS-CoV-2 immunity, while the immune boosting effect of dose 2 was minimal.Thus, adjustments to the current vaccine dosing regimen are necessary to optimizeimmunization efficacy and cost-effectiveness. While Sputnik-V reactogenicity issimilar to that of other COVID-19 vaccines, the induced alterations to theGRO/platelet axis warrant investigation of the vaccine's effects on systemicimmunology.

AB  - Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) characterized by the absence ofdetectable HBsAg in the presence of HBV DNA in the serum and/or liver tissueremains a potential risk of transmission and diseases progression among differentpopulation groups. It could be associated with asymptomatic case up to chronicliver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of thisstudy was to assess the magnitude and characteristics of OBI among patients with CLD of unidentified cause in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study was conducted atthe gastroenterology & hepatology referral clinic of three government and twoprivate hospitals in Addis Ababa. Known CLD patients as evidenced by clinical andimaging criteria and/or with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative results usingrapid test kit were included. ELISA serological test to anti-HBc Ab, anti HBsAgAb, and HBsAg were determined using BIORAD kits [ https://www.bio-rad.com ].HBV-DNA was amplified, and viral loads were determined by quantitative real-time PCR using Abbott m2000rt platform following the manufacturer's instructions. Dataanalysis was done using SPSS version 20.A total of 48 CLD patients with noidentified cause for their liver disease were identified during the study period.All the patients had evidence of CLD by clinical and imaging criteria and ninewere excluded. Three (7.69%) of the 39 patients tested positive for HBsAg testdone by ELISA making the negative predictive value of the rapid test kits 92.3%compared to ELISA. The remaining 36 patients had serology test for HBV and 16(44.4%) had positive anti-HBV core antibody. Two (5.56%) of the 36 patients with HBV viral load determination had detectable HBV DNA suggesting presence of anoccult hepatitis B infection. Occult hepatitis B infection is found to be anaetiology among CLD patients labelled as having no identified cause by thecurrent standard of care using rapid HBsAg kits in a subset of patients inEthiopia. This study signifies the high rate of OBI and past evidence of HBVinfection among CLD patients and thus nucleic acid testing and/or anti-HBc shall be integrated to the routine health care system to minimize HBV infection risk oftransmission and to enhance patient care.

AB  - Apolipoprotein E (APOE) plays a pivotal role in lipid including cholesterolmetabolism. The APOE epsilon4 (APOE4) allele is a major genetic risk factor forAlzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases. Although APOE has recently beenassociated with increased susceptibility to infections of several viruses,whether and how APOE and its isoforms affect SARS-CoV-2 infection remainsunclear. Here, we show that serum concentrations of APOE correlate inversely withlevels of cytokine/chemokine in 73 COVID-19 patients. Utilizing multiple protein interaction assays, we demonstrate that APOE3 and APOE4 interact with theSARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2; and APOE/ACE2 interactions require zincmetallopeptidase domain of ACE2, a key docking site for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.In addition, immuno-imaging assays using confocal, super-resolution, andtransmission electron microscopies reveal that both APOE3 and APOE4 reduceACE2/Spike-mediated viral entry into cells. Interestingly, while having acomparable binding affinity to ACE2, APOE4 inhibits viral entry to a lesserextent compared to APOE3, which is likely due to APOE4's more compact structureand smaller spatial obstacle to compete against Spike binding to ACE2.Furthermore, APOE epsilon4 carriers clinically correlate with increasedSARS-CoV-2 infection and elevated serum inflammatory factors in 142 COVID-19patients assessed. Our study suggests a regulatory mechanism underlyingSARS-CoV-2 infection through APOE interactions with ACE2, which may explain inpart increased COVID-19 infection and disease severity in APOE epsilon4 carriers.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have continuously evolved and may erode vaccineinduced immunity. In this observational cohort study, we determine the risk ofbreakthrough infection in a fully vaccinated cohort. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgGlevels were measured before first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and at day 21-28, 90 and180, as well as after booster vaccination. Breakthrough infections were captured through the Danish National Microbiology database. incidence rate ratio (IRR) forbreakthrough infection at time-updated anti-spike IgG levels was determined usingPoisson regression. Among 6076 participants, 127 and 364 breakthrough infections due to Delta and Omicron variants were observed. IRR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.15-0.56) for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant, comparing the highest andlowest quintiles of anti-spike IgG. For Omicron, no significant differences inIRR were observed. These results suggest that quantitative level of anti-spikeIgG have limited impact on the risk of breakthrough infection with Omicron.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate a vaccine technology with potential to protect againstcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and reduce transmission of severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with a single vaccine dose, wedeveloped a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine using the live vesicular stomatitisvirus (VSV) chimeric virus approach previously used to develop a licensed Ebolavirus vaccine. METHODS: We generated a replication-competent chimericVSV-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by replacing the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene with coding sequence for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S). Immunogenicity of the lead vaccine candidate (VSVG-SARS-CoV-2) was evaluated in cotton rats and golden Syrian hamsters, and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection also was assessed inhamsters. FINDINGS: VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 delivered with a single intramuscular (IM)injection was immunogenic in cotton rats and hamsters and protected hamsters fromweight loss following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. When mucosal vaccination wasevaluated, cotton rats did not respond to the vaccine, whereas mucosaladministration of VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 was found to be more immunogenic than IMinjection in hamsters and induced immunity that significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus loads in both lung and nasal tissues. INTERPRETATION:VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 delivered by IM injection or mucosal administration wasimmunogenic in golden Syrian hamsters, and both vaccination methods effectivelyprotected the lung from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hamsters vaccinated by mucosalapplication of VSVG-SARS-CoV-2 also developed immunity that controlled SARS-CoV-2replication in nasal tissue. FUNDING: The study was funded by Merck Sharp &Dohme, Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, and TheInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative, Inc. (IAVI), New York, USA. Parts of this research was supported by the Biomedical Advanced Research and DevelopmentAuthority (BARDA) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) of the USDepartment of Defense.

AB  - PURPOSE: HBV DNA quantification is used for individuals with uninterpretableserological tests, occult HBV infections, decreasing the window period of thedisease, and treatment follow-up. Although there are commercial qPCR assays, theyare expensive. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive quantitative TaqManReal-Time PCR with an exogenous internal control to quantify HBV DNA inserum/plasma. METHODS: A specific primer/probe set was designed for the Sconserved region of various HBV genotypes. The primer/probe set was evaluatedexperimentally and in-silico. An exogenous internal control was included tomonitor the effects of inhibitors. The standard plasmid was titrated using three different methods to prepare the seven standards for the assay. The functionalcharacteristics of the in-house assay were evaluated using the standards. Twohundred clinical specimens were also tested. RESULTS: The LOD of the in-houseassay was 40 IU/mL, and the assay was linear from 3.26Log10 to 9.26Log10 IU/mL.The analytical and clinical sensitivity of the assay was 100% and 92.15%,respectively. The analytical and clinical specificity of the assay was 100% and98.97%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the assaywere determined to be 98.94% and 92.38%, respectively. The highest coefficient ofvariation of the inter/intra-assay was 5.1%. The accuracy was close to 100% forall standards, and the correlation between the in-house assay and commercial kit AltoStar(R) PCR Kits 1.5 was remarkable. The results of the clinical samplesusing the standards titrated using AcroMetrix HBV Panel, Artus(R) HBV RG PCR Kit,and AltoStar(R) PCR Kits 1.5 were comparable (r = 0.942, 0.951, 0.951).CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the in-house assay is highly sensitive andspecific, reproducible, and cost-benefit. Thus, it can be used to detect andquantify HBV DNA in research and clinical settings.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, responsible for the severe acuterespiratory syndrome known as COVID-19, has rapidly spread in almost everycountry and devastated the global economy and health care system. Lung injury is an early disease manifestation believed to be a major contributor to short- andlong-term pathological consequences of COVID-19, and thus drug discovery aimingto ameliorate lung injury could be a potential strategy to treat COVID-19patients. By inducing a severe acute respiratory syndrome-like pulmonary disease model through infecting A/J mice with murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1), weshow that i.v. administration of pazopanib ameliorates acute lung injurieswithout affecting MHV-1 replication. Pazopanib reduces cell apoptosis inMHV-1-infected lungs. Furthermore, we also identified that pazopanib has to begiven no later than 48 h after the virus infection without compromising thetherapeutic effect. Our study provides a potential treatment forcoronavirus-induced lung injuries and support for further evaluation of pazopanibin COVID-19 patients.

LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-009430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A few studies have assessed the epidemiological impact and thecost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in settings where most of the population had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted acost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 vaccine in Kenya from a societalperspective over a 1.5-year time frame. An age-structured transmission modelassumed at least 80% of the population to have prior natural immunity when animmune escape variant was introduced. We examine the effect of slow (18 months)or rapid (6 months) vaccine roll-out with vaccine coverage of 30%, 50% or 70% of the adult (>18 years) population prioritising roll-out in those over 50-years(80% uptake in all scenarios). Cost data were obtained from primary analyses. We assumed vaccine procurement at US$7 per dose and vaccine delivery costs ofUS$3.90-US$6.11 per dose. The cost-effectiveness threshold was US$919.11.FINDINGS: Slow roll-out at 30% coverage largely targets those over 50 years andresulted in 54% fewer deaths (8132 (7914-8373)) than no vaccination and was cost saving (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER=US$-1343 (US$-1345 toUS$-1341) per disability-adjusted life-year, DALY averted). Increasing coverageto 50% and 70%, further reduced deaths by 12% (810 (757-872) and 5% (282(251-317) but was not cost-effective, using Kenya's cost-effectiveness threshold (US$919.11). Rapid roll-out with 30% coverage averted 63% more deaths and wasmore cost-saving (ICER=US$-1607 (US$-1609 to US$-1604) per DALY averted) comparedwith slow roll-out at the same coverage level, but 50% and 70% coverage scenarioswere not cost-effective. INTERPRETATION: With prior exposure partially protectingmuch of the Kenyan population, vaccination of young adults may no longer becost-effective.

AB  - There are few studies on the severity and prognosis of patients infected with thesevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant.From January 11, 2022 to January 25, 2022, 181 patients were infected with theSARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in a single hospital in Korea. The initial clinicalcharacteristics were investigated through the COVID-19 basic investigation form. Outcomes were reviewed using medical records. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range 1-90), and 95 patients (52.5%) were male. None were re-infectedwith SARS-CoV-2, and 127 (70.2%) were fully vaccinated (boosted or within 6months after second vaccination). Forty-two patients (23.2%) were asymptomatic.Among symptomatic patients, the frequency of symptoms was as follows: cough(37.0%), sore throat (33.7%), and fever (30.4%). In terms of disease severity,168 (92.8%) patients did not require supplemental oxygen, 6 (3.3%) requiredlow-flow oxygen, 5 (2.8%) required high-flow oxygen, and 2 (1.1%) died. Four ofthe five individuals who required high-flow oxygen and the two who died were not vaccinated. Most of the patients who contracted the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variantexhibited mild clinical features; however, severe clinical features includingmortality were encountered among individuals who were not vaccinated.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of intervention policies on coronavirusdisease-19 (COVID-19) dissemination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An age-structuredcompartmental model for the COVID-19 outbreak was proposed to predict the impact of control measures in the Seoul/Gyeonggi region. The model was calibrated based on actual data and realistic situations, including daily vaccine doses,proportion of delta variant cases, and confirmed cases by age. We simulateddifferent scenarios for non-pharmaceutical interventions by varying socialdistancing and school attendance strategies. RESULTS: Two-step mitigation ofsocial distancing without in-person classes would result in a rapid increase inconfirmed cases up to 10000 but would keep severe cases within the manageablerange of the health care system. The overall impact of taking down the distancinglevel by one step with twice the increase in contacts at school was comparable tothe above scenario. Implementation of two-step mitigation of social distancingalong with a two-fold increase in contacts among the school-age group woulddramatically increase confirmed and severe cases by over 80000 and 100,respectively, as early as the beginning of December. This policy would cause the situation to spiral out of control, considering the scale of the response andtime to prepare. On the other hand, the burden on the current healthcare systemcaused by two-step mitigation of social distancing and 40% increased contacts in the school-age group was manageable if prepared. CONCLUSION: A compromise betweensocial distancing and school attendance policy and timely preparations for thespread of COVID-19 are required.

AB  - Although SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness and death, a percentage of theinfected population is asymptomatic. This, along with other factors, such asinsufficient diagnostic testing and underreporting due to self-testing,contributes to the silent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and highlights theimportance of implementing additional surveillance tools. The fecal shedding ofthe virus from infected individuals enables its detection in communitywastewater, and this has become a valuable public health tool worldwide as itallows the monitoring of the disease on a populational scale. Here, we monitored the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its dynamic genomic changes in wastewater sampled from two metropolitan areas in Arkansas during major surges of COVID-19 cases andassessed how the viral titers in these samples related to the clinical casecounts between late April 2020 and January 2022. The levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAwere quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) using a set of TaqMan assays targeting three different viral genes(encoding ORF1ab polyprotein, surface glycoprotein, and nucleocapsidphosphoprotein). An allele-specific RT-qPCR approach was used to screen thesamples for SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The identity and genetic diversity of the viruswere further investigated through amplicon-based RNA sequencing, and SARS-CoV-2variants of concern were detected in wastewater samples throughout the durationof this study. Our data show how changes in the virus genome can affect thesensitivity of specific RT-qPCR assays used in COVID-19 testing with the surge ofnew variants. A significant association was observed between viral titers inwastewater and recorded number of COVID-19 cases in the areas studied, exceptwhen assays failed to detect targets due to the presence of particular variants. These findings support the use of wastewater surveillance as a reliablecomplementary tool for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic variants at thecommunity level.

AB  - Introducing multi-dose formulations of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines willreduce costs and enable improved global vaccine coverage, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This work describes the development of key analyticalmethods later utilized for HPV vaccine multi-dose formulation development. First,down-selection of physicochemical methods suitable for multi-dose formulationdevelopment of four HPV (6, 11, 16, and 18) Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) adsorbed to an aluminum adjuvant (Alhydrogel(R), AH) was performed. The four monovalentAH-adsorbed HPV VLPs were then characterized using these down-selected methods.Second, stability-indicating competitive ELISA assays were developed using HPVserotype-specific neutralizing mAbs, to monitor relative antibody bindingprofiles of the four AH-adsorbed VLPs during storage. Third,concentration-dependent preservative-induced destabilization of HPV16 VLPs wasdemonstrated by addition of eight preservatives found in parenterallyadministered pharmaceuticals and vaccines, as measured by ELISA, dynamic lightscattering, and differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, preservativestability and effectiveness in the presence of vaccine components were evaluated using a combination of RP-UHPLC, a microbial growth inhibition assay, and amodified version of the European Pharmacopoeia assay (Ph. Eur. 5.1.3). Resultsare discussed in terms of analytical challenges encountered to identify anddevelop high-throughput methods that facilitate multi-dose formulationdevelopment of aluminum-adjuvanted protein-based vaccine candidates.
